% * the effect NA% has on the other variables
Furthermore, if the missing data are linearly interpolated this effect becomes even more pronounced and the reported significance of all trends increases dramaticaly (See Appendix). This means that linear interpolation is not an acceptable method of filling in missing data in a time series analysis and should be avoided where possible. This creates an unfortunately strict requirement on the quality of time series, as many \emph{in situ} time series may have greater than 5\%NA (cite?). Therefore it is our reccomendation that further research be conducted on succesful methods of interpolating missing values so as not to unduly affect the significance and accuracy of fitted models.
