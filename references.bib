@article{Lomax2005,
abstract = { The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) provides a framework to integrate environmental data with existing and new technologies resulting in information that will improve our use and management of oceanic and coastal areas. The coastal zone is a dynamic biological, chemical, physical, and geological environment that is rich with opportunities for commerce and in need of well thought out resource management and conservation. In order to maintain responsible stewardship of this delicate environment while sharing coastal resources for economic benefit, we must have a means to measure, monitor, and characterize processes, parameters, and habitats accurately, in a timely fashion, and cost-effectively. While in situ observations and measurements provide the most precise and accurate means of data collection, this method is limited by its coarse spatial and/or temporal resolution and the potentially high cost of increasing fidelity. Satellite remote sensing provides a means of collecting large geographic views of data, but the information available from satellites can be constrained by (1) the spatial and spectral resolution of the sensor, (2) atmospheric absorption and other effects, (3) data refresh time of sensor platforms, and (4) cost. Airborne remote sensing provides a mechanism for overcoming shortcomings of space-borne sensors but typically at a high cost and with restrictions on flight regulations and endurance. In some types of operations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are less expensive and more flexible to operate than manned aircraft and continuing developments in the field are increasing the operational capabilities of these platforms and the variety of available sensors for data collection. Employment of UAV platforms and associated sensors, coordinated with in situ and other remote sensors, provides a powerful tool in characterizing the coastal ocean for habitat monitoring, hazard response and mitigation, resource management, and commercial use. UAVs can be a critically important element of the national coastal component of IOOS.},

abstract = {Subsidy between ecosystems has been considered in many natural ecosystems, and should alter food webs and communities in human-impacted ones. We estimated how drifting plankton from a reservoir contribute to downstream food webs and showed that they alter community structures over a 10-km reach below the dam. To estimate the contribution of the drifting plankton to macroinvertebrates, we used C and N isotopes and an Iso-Source mixing model. In spring and autumn, contributions of plankton to collector-filterer species were highest 0.2 km downstream of the dam, and clearly decreased from 0.2 to 10 km. At 0.2 km, the contribution of plankton to a predator stonefly was remarkably high. These results indicated that drifting plankton from a dam reservoir could subsidize downstream food webs and alter their energy base, but the importance of this subsidy decreased as distance from the reservoir increased. The general linear models indicated that the abundance of collector-filterers and predators was related positively to zooplankton density in stream water. Thus, food source alteration by drifting plankton also influenced the community structures downstream of the dam.},

abstract = {Cephalocereus columna-trajani is a giant columnar cactus endemic of the Tehu{\'{a}}can-Cuicatl{\'{a}}n Valley in Central Mexico. Stem tilting and northward pseudocephalium azimuth in C. columna-trajani have functional advantages in terms of interception of direct solar radiation at the northernmost portions of its range. Since the success of both characters strongly depends on the apparent position of the sun during the growing season, in this paper we test the hypothesis that the occurrence of such columnar morphology is restricted geographically and imposes mechanical restrictions that limit column height. Following a latitudinal gradient along the Tehuac{\'{a}}n-Cuicatl{\'{a}}n Valley, we selected five populations, recorded tilting angle and pseudocephalium azimuth, and carried out allometric and biomechanical analyses of height-diameter relationships. Northern populations showed higher tilting angles. Pseudocephalium azimuth significantly differed among populations, and pseudocephalium orientation was consistently North-Northwestern. Stem allometry showed that the stems of the southern populations increased in height at a far greater rate with respect to diameter than the northern populations. The southernmost population showed the lowest safety factor. These results support the hypothesis that stem tilting in C. columna-trajani is functionally advantageous in a restricted geographical range, and imposes mechanical restrictions to column height.},

abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

abstract = {Recent advances in quantifying biochemical and cellular-level responses to thermal stress have facilitated a new exploration of the role of climate and climate change in driving intertidal community and population ecology. To fruitfully connect these disciplines, we first need to understand what the body temperatures of intertidal organisms are under field conditions, and how they change in space and time. Newly available data logger technology makes such an exploration possible, but several potential pitfalls must be avoided. Body temperature during aerial exposure is driven by multiple, interacting climatic factors, and extremes during low tide far exceed those during submersion. Moreover, because of effects of body size and morphology, two organisms exposed to identical climatic conditions can display very different body temperatures, which can also be substantially different from the temperature of the surrounding air. These same factors drive the temperature recorded by data loggers, and one logger type is unlikely to serve as an effective proxy for all organisms at a site. Here I describe the difficulties involved in quantifying patterns of body temperature in intertidal organisms, and explore the implications of this complexity for intertidal physiological ecology. I do so using data from temperature loggers designed to mimic the thermal characteristics of the mussel Mytilus californianus, and deployed at multiple sites along the West Coast of the United States. Results indicate a highly intricate pattern of thermal stress, where the interaction of climate with the dynamics of the tidal cycle determines the timing and magnitude of temperature extremes, creating a unique "thermal signal" at each site.},

abstract = {The changes of titratable acidity, enzyme activity, water status, and pigment composition were studied in Portulacaria afra (L.) Jacq. during a normal summer drought and rewatering. Two groups of plants were grown outside under a clear plastic canopy with water stress initiated at 2-week intervals in May 1986. Drought resulted in a linear decrease of fresh weight for 80 days and there was no further fresh weight change for the next 65 days. Nocturnal CO2 uptake remained measurable for 83 days. Cessation of exogenous CO2 uptake corresponded to the point where the pressure potential ( {\$}\backslashpsi {\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}p{\}}{\}}{\$} ) became zero. Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate (RuBP) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase were reduced to 50{\%} of this activity by the end of the drought period. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity was undetectable after 120 to 140 days of drought. Chlorophyll (Chl) levels decreased with a preferential loss of Chl a over Chl b. Carotenoid content was relatively constant over the course of the drought period. After 145 days of drought, plants responded to rewatering within 24 hours; {\$}\backslashpsi {\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}p{\}}{\}}{\$} became positive and daytime CO2 uptake resumed after 24 hours. After 3 days, RuBP carboxylase activity reached control levels. Activity of the CAM pathway recovered after 5 days, as noted by increased diurnal acid fluctuations. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity fully recovered within 6 days. Chl levels were greater than control levels within 5 days. Chl a/b ratios took 27 days to return to control levels. The results indicated that P. afra can withstand a normal summer drought by utilizing the CAM and CAM-idling pathway for 130 to 140 days. The plants respond rapidly to rewatering because of the conservation of enzyme activity and the quick recovery of {\$}\backslashpsi {\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}p{\}}{\}}{\$} .},

abstract = {The arctic kelp, Laminaria solidungula, is a predominant member of the Boulder Patch kelp bed community in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea and serves as both food and shelter for a diverse assemblage of marine invertebrate fauna. The growth and productivity of L. solidungula is related to its underwater light environment, which varies considerably on both spatial and temporal scales. Continuous measurement of the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reaching the plants was examined in August 1984 and continuously from August 1986 to August 1991.. Specially designed water-tight chambers containing U-COR data loggers were deployed by divers at seven locations on the seabed. Maximum daytime levels of PAR showed large seasonal differences, ranging from 0 to 15 micro mol photons m-2s-1 during the ice-covered period to between 0 and 250 micro mol photons m-2s-1 during the open-water season. Periods of decreased water transparency during the summer and large patches of turbid ice in winter were the major causes of low or undetectable levels of PAR. The lowest annual quantum budgets for L. solidungula ranged from 45 to 50 mol m{\^{}}-2s{\^{}}-1, which represented only about 0.2{\%} of total surface PAR. Although, previous studies indicate that L. solidungula possesses a very low light requirement for net photosynthetic carbon production, our data indicate that this species is living at its physiological limits in the Beaufort Sea Boulder Patch.},

abstract = {Abundance-body size relationships are widely observed macroecological patterns in complete food webs and in taxonomically or functionally defined subsets of those webs. Observed abundance-body size relationships have frequently been compared with predictions based on the energetic equivalence hypothesis and, more recently, with predictions based on energy availability to different body size classes. Here, we consider the ways in which working with taxonomically or functionally defined subsets of food webs affected the relationship between the predicted and observed scaling of biomass and body mass in sediment dwelling benthic invertebrate communities at three sites in the North Sea. At each site, the energy available to body size classes in the "whole" community (community defined as all animals of 0.03125-32.0 g shell-free wet weight) and in three subsets was predicted from estimates of trophic level based on nitrogen stable isotope analysis. The observed and predicted scalings of biomass and body size were not significantly different for the whole community, and reflected an increase in energy availability with body size. However, the results for subsets showed that energy availability could increase or decrease with body size, and that individuals in the subsets were likely to be competing with individuals outside the subsets for energy. We conclude that the study of abundancebody mass relationships in functionally or taxonomi cally defined subsets of food webs is unlikely to provide an adequate test of the energetic equivalence hypothesis or other relationships between energy availability and scaling. To consistently and reliably interpret the results of these tests, it is necessary to know about energy availability as a function of body size both within and outside the subset considered.},

abstract = {Abstract. Cormorants are desirable subjects for food web studies using stable isotopes (C and N) because of global fisheries conflicts, but no validated lipid-normalization procedures are currently available for any cormorant species. Accordingly, the effects of chloroform-methanol and petroleum-ether lipid extractions and three published lipid-normalization models on stable C and N isotope signatures in Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) muscle and liver tissues were investigated. The presence of lipids in cormorant muscle and liver decreased $\delta$13C values by approximately 1–2‰, more so than has been reported in other birds. Cormorants showed large variation in the relationship between the C:N ratio of bulk tissue and the change in $\delta$13C values after lipid extraction, violating a major assumption of published lipid-normalization models. Despite this violation, two of the three tested models performed reasonably well for correcting $\delta$13C values. The circumstances under which these models might f...},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are major tools to protect biodiversity and sustain fisheries. For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of MPA networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between MPAs remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred MPAs. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean MPAs are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each MPA was directly connected to four others and MPAs were clustered into several groups. Two MPAs (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of MPA distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20{\%} of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected MPAs providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more.},

abstract = {The diet of Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) in central coastal California consists of a mixture of high-quality (insects) and low-quality (stored acorns) food during the spring breeding season. We used stable isotope ratios obtained from blood samples to estimate possible differences in the proportion of these items being fed to nestlings and being consumed by breeding adults, as well as the extent to which the diet of nestlings shifts between insects and acorns during the nestling period. Based on both feeding observations and items recovered from nestlings, older nestlings were fed 28{\%} acorns. Using this value as a baseline for the isotope analyses, the diet of breeding adults was estimated to consist of 90{\%} acorns. Based on repeated samples from the same nestlings over time, the estimated proportion of acorns in their diet increased from 19{\%} in 9- to 12-d-old nestlings to 42{\%} in 23- to 26-d-old nestlings. There was a significant correlation between the isotope values of adults and the nestlings they fed, indicating that different groups of Acorn Woodpeckers have significantly different diets. Although important for successful reproduction in this species, stored acorns are not the primary food resource used to feed young. Instead, the availability of stored acorns allows adult Acorn Woodpeckers to provide nestlings with more protein-rich insects while maintaining themselves on relatively protein-poor, low-quality acorns. Differences in the diets of adults and their nestlings are likely widespread among species that feed, at least in part, on low-quality foods, such as fruit and seeds, during the breeding season. /// La dieta de Melanerpes formicivorus en la parte central costera de California, consiste de una mezcla de insectos y de bellotas que las aves almacenan durante la {\'{e}}poca reproductiva primaveral.

abstract = {Aim: Ecologists have generally agreed that beta diversity is a key component of global patterns of species richness. Incorporating phylogenetic information into the study of beta diversity allows researchers to identify the degree to which the shared evolutionary histories of species explain ecological patterns observed today. For example, phylogenetic analyses can determine whether closely related species tend to occupy similar positions along broad climatic gradients and whether this explains the compositional turnover along these gradients. Despite the promise of phylogenetic beta diversity analyses, few continental-scale investigations exist. Here, we quantify the phylogenetic beta diversity and taxonomic beta diversity of the angiosperm flora across North America. We relate these metrics to one another and to geographical and environmental distances to uncover the phylogenetic signal underlying species compositional turnover. Location: North America. Method: Seventy-one regional floras were used and assigned into five latitudinal zones and two longitudinal bands. The S{\o}rensen index and PhyloSor index were used to quantify taxonomic similarity and phylogenetic similarity, respectively, between floras, and were related to geographical and environmental distances. Results: Phylogenetic similarity between floras is strongly correlated with taxonomic similarity, is higher in eastern North America than in western North America, and increases strikingly with latitude. Geographical and environmental distances together explained on average about 76{\%} of the variation in phylogenetic beta diversity with environmental distance explaining more variation in phylogenetic similarity in three of the four latitudinal bands examined. Main conclusions: The results show that phylogenetic beta diversity is consistently lower than taxonomic beta diversity, which suggests that the spatial turnover of species in the study system is predominantly the spatial turnover of closely related species and not distantly related species. Thus, the turnover of angiosperm floras in North America is best explained by small divergences along environmental axes for closely related species and a gradual turnover of lineages through space.},

abstract = {Streams and rivers host a significant portion of Earth’s biodiversity and pro- vide important ecosystem services for human populations. Accurate information regarding the status andtrends of stream resources is vital for their effective conser- vation and management.Most statistical techniques applied to data measured on stream networkswere developed for terrestrial applications and are not optimized for streams. A new class of spatial statistical model, based on valid covariance structures for stream networks, can be used with many common types of stream data (e.g., water quality attributes, habitat conditions, biological surveys) through application of appropriate distributions (e.g., Gaussian, binomial, Poisson). The spatial statistical network models account for spatial autocorrelation (i.e., nonin- dependence) among measurements, which allows their application to databases with clustered measurement locations. Large amounts of stream data exist inmany areas where spatial statistical analyses could be used to develop novel insights, improve predictions at unsampled sites, and aid in the design of efficient monitor- ing strategies at relatively low cost.We review the topic of spatial autocorrelation and its effects on statistical inference, demonstrate the use of spatial statisticswith stream datasets relevant to common research and management questions, and discuss additional applications and development potential for spatial statistics on stream networks. Free software for implementing the spatial statistical network models has been developed that enables custom applications with many stream databases. ©},

abstract = {RATIONALE:Stable isotope values ($\delta$(13)C and $\delta$(15)N) of darted skin and blubber biopsies can shed light on habitat use and diet of cetaceans, which are otherwise difficult to study. Non-dietary factors affect isotopic variability, chiefly the depletion of (13)C due to the presence of (12)C-rich lipids. The efficacy of post hoc lipid-correction models (normalization) must be tested.

METHODS:For tissues with high natural lipid content (e.g., whale skin and blubber), chemical lipid extraction or normalization is necessary. C:N ratios, $\delta$(13)C values and $\delta$(15)N values were determined for duplicate control and lipid-extracted skin and blubber of fin (Balaenoptera physalus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and minke whales (B. acutorostrata) by continuous-flow elemental analysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-EA-IRMS). Six different normalization models were tested to correct $\delta$(13)C values for the presence of lipids.

RESULTS:Following lipid extraction, significant increases in $\delta$(13)C values were observed for both tissues in the three species. Significant increases were also found for $\delta$(15)N values in minke whale skin and fin whale blubber. In fin whale skin, the $\delta$(15)N values decreased, with no change observed in humpback whale skin. Non-linear models generally out-performed linear models and the suitability of models varied by species and tissue, indicating the need for high model specificity, even among these closely related taxa.

CONCLUSIONS:Given the poor predictive power of the models to estimate lipid-free $\delta$(13)C values, and the unpredictable changes in $\delta$(15)N values due to lipid-extraction, we recommend against arithmetical normalization in accounting for lipid effects on $\delta$(13)C values for balaenopterid skin or blubber samples. Rather, we recommend that duplicate analysis of lipid-extracted ($\delta$(13)C values) and non-treated tissues ($\delta$(15)N values) be used.},

Ulva prolifera, the causative species of green tide, showed great ability to acclimate to adverse circumstance. To explore the mechanisms of rapid growth and stress resistance during the bloom, we characterized and analyzed hsp70 from U. prolifera. The results showed that hsp70 gene had 6 exons and 5 introns. The promoter-like region contained multiple cis-acting elements. The transcription of hsp70 was up-regulated by UV irradiation, heat treatment and salinities induction, but less influenced by desiccation. In vitro expression of HSP70 protein and western blot was also conducted, and the recombinant protein will be used in detecting the interaction between HSP70 and related functional proteins in the future. The study suggested that hsp70 could be used in prediction of stress tolerance in algae and monitoring environmental changes.},

abstract = {Desert pavements of white quartz stones (quartz fields) represent azonal habitats in several arid regions of southern Africa. The vegetation of these quartz fields is characterised by dwarf and highly succulent growth forms which contrast strongly with the shrubby vegetation of the surroundings. Incoming and reflected global solar radiation, air temperature near the ground, soil-surface temperatures and leaf-surface temperatures of dwarf plants were determined under natural habitat conditions inside and outside of the quartz fields. Surface temperatures of quartz and shale stones were compared. The study was conducted in the Knersvlakte and the Little Karoo (Succulent-Karoo Biome), South Africa. The daily maximum temperatures of the air near the ground of quartz fields was several degrees lower than the air near the ground of neighbouring soils without quartz cover. Maximum soil-surface temperatures of the quartz fields, however, were only lower in summer. Accordingly, the leave surfaces of dwarf plants (Aizoaceae) growing inside quartz fields were up to 3 K cooler than identical plants outside the quartz fields. The lower maximum temperatures is associated with an about 5{\%} higher reflection of quartz fields compared to neighbouring soils without quartz cover. At night, the minimum temperatures of the air near the ground and the soil surface temperatures on quartz fields were above those of soils without quartz cover. The nocturnal surface temperatures of quartz stones did not differ considerably from that of shale and often ranged above the temperatures and dew-point of the ambient air. Consequently, the relatively cooler quartz fields seem to provide less adverse growing conditions for plants near the ground compared to surrounding soils without quartz cover.},

@article{Tuomisto2010,
abstract = {The term beta diversity has been used to refer to a wide variety of phenomena. Although all of these encompass some kind of compositional heterogeneity between places, many are not related to each other in any predictable way. The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called beta diversity into a common conceptual framework, and to explain what each of them measures. In this first part, the focus is on defining a beta component of diversity. This involves deciding what diversity is and how the observed total or gamma diversity ($\gamma$) is partitioned into alpha ($\alpha$) and beta ($\beta$) components. Several different definitions of "beta diversity" that result from these decisions have been used in the ecological literature. True beta diversity is obtained when the total effective number of species in a dataset (true gamma diversity $\gamma$) is multiplicatively partitioned into the effective number of species per compositionally distinct virtual sampling unit (true alpha diversity {\$}\backslashalpha {\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}d{\}}{\}}{\$} ) and the effective number of such compositional units ( {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}Md{\}}{\}}=\backslashgamma /\backslashalpha {\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}d{\}}{\}}{\$} ). All true diversities quantify the effective number of types of entities. Because the other variants of "beta diversity" that have been used by ecologists quantify other phenomena, an alternative nomenclature is proposed here for the seven most popular beta components: regional-to-local diversity ratio, two-way diversity ratio, absolute effective species turnover (=regional diversity excess), Whittaker's effective species turnover, proportional effective species turnover, regional entropy excess and regional variance excess. In the second part of the review, the focus will be on how to quantify these phenomena in practice. This involves deciding how the sampling units that contribute to total diversity are selected, and whether the entity that is quantified is all of "beta diversity", a specific part of "beta diversity", the rate of change in "beta diversity" in relation to a given external factor, or something else.},

abstract = {Ion exclusion chromatograph (IEC) isotope dilution (ID) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (IEC-ID-ICP-MS) was developed for measurement of dissolved silica in seawater, which was applied to production of certified reference materials (CRMs) of three concentration levels of nutrients (high, medium and low levels). IEC-ICP-MS has been employed to separate dissolved silica from seawater matrix. In the present study, in order to solve substantial problems due to spectral interference in ICP-MS and to improve the accuracy of IEC-ICP-MS beyond standard addition or conventional calibration methods, ID method was coupled with ICP-sector field mass spectrometry (operated under medium resolution,i.e., m/$\Delta$m=4000). In addition, effects of various operating parameters in ICP-MS on a silicon background level were also investigated to obtain lower background equivalent concentration (BEC). As a result, 3 ng g(-1) of the BEC and 0.5 {\%} of relative standard uncertainties were achieved in the analyses of dissolved silica in seawater samples at concentration levels from 4.0 mg kg (-1) to 0.8 mg kg(-1) as silicon. The developed method was successfully validated by analyses of an artificial seawater containing a known amount of silicate and the seawater certified reference material MOOS-2 produced by the National Research Council Canada.},

abstract = {Seasonal carbon and water relations were compared among seven tree or shrub wash woodland species in the winter rainfall desert of the Richtersveld National Park, South Africa. Plants were generally aseasonal with respect to gas exchange, but responsive to rainfall events with respect to water relations and phenology. Relatively narrow annual ranges in potential evapotranspiration due to the maritime influence could explain why these plants respond more to fluctuations in water acquisition potential than to evaporative demand. Two species were summer-deciduous, but one of them (Ozoroa concolor) responded to aseasonal summer rainfall by leafing out and flowering. These two species had high shoot xylem water potentials when in leaf. All other species were sclerophyllous evergreens with low water potentials, particularly the shallow-rooted shrub Zygophyllum prismatocarpum, and Boscia albitrunca which may have a different rooting pattern to the other phreatophytes. The latter species was also unique due to its high leaf nitrogen contents, photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductances, despite very low leaf water potentials. Leaf stable carbon isotope composition ( {\$}{\{}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}\backslashdelta \backslashtext{\{}C{\}}{\$} ) varied between species (-22 to -27‰), but was lower than the mean for arid regions worldwide. The values indicated moderately high levels of water use efficiency, but a less conservative strategy in two species, including Boscia albitrunca. The affinities of these species to summer rainfall biomes, their apparent decline in the western arid regions in recent geological history following aridification, and their absence southwards in the winter rainfall regions, suggest that these wash species rely on sporadic summer rainfall events to some extent. They may be at risk if predicted increases in temperature and changes in rainfall patterns alter their effective moisture availability., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

abstract = {Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6°C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that fishing can trigger trophic cascades and alter food web dynamics, yet its effects on ecosystem function remain largely unkonwn. We used the large-scale experimental framework of four marine reserves, spanning an oceanographic gradient in northeastern New Zealand, to test the extent to which the exploitation of reef predators can alter kelp carbon flux and secondary production. We provide evidence that the reduction of predatory snapper (Pagrus auratus) and lobster (Jasus edwardsii) can lead to an increase in sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) and indirect declines in kelp biomass in some locations but not others. Stable carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$13C) of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Perna canaliculus) transplanted in reserve and fished sites within four locations revealed that fishing indirectly reduced the proportion of kelp-derived organic carbon assimilated by filter feeders in two locations where densities of actively grazing sea urchins were 23.7 and 8.3 times higher and kelp biomass was an order of magnitude lower than in non-fished reserve sites. In contrast, in the two locations where fishing had no effect on urchin density or kelp biomass, we detected no effect of fishing on the carbon signature of filter feeders. We show that the effects of fishing on nearshore trophic structure and carbon flux are context-dependent and hinge on large-scale, regional oceanographic factors. Where cascading effects of fishing on kelp biomass were documented, enhanced assimilation of kelp carbon did not result in the magnification of secondary production. Instead, a strong regional gradient in filter feeder growth emerged, best predicted by chlorophyll a. Estimates of kelp contribution to the diet of transplanted consumers averaged 56.9{\%} ± 6.2{\%} (mean ± SE) for mussels and 33.8{\%} ± 7.3{\%} for oysters, suggesting that organic carbon fixed by kelp is an important food source fueling northeastern New Zealand's nearshore food webs. The importance of predators in mediating benthic primary production and organic carbon flux suggests that overfishing can have profound consequences on ecosystem functioning particularly where pelagic primary production is limiting. Our results underscore the broader ecosystem repercussions of overfishing and its context-dependent effects.},

@article{Franzke2012,
abstract = {This study investigates the significance of trends of four temperature time series—Central England Temperature
(CET), Stockholm, Faraday-Vernadsky, and Alert. First the robustness and accuracy of various trend detection
methods are examined: ordinary least squares, robust and generalized linear model regression, Ensemble Empirical
Mode Decomposition (EEMD), and wavelets. It is found in tests with surrogate data that these trend
detection methods are robust for nonlinear trends, superposed autocorrelated fluctuations, and non-Gaussian
fluctuations. An analysis of the four temperature time series reveals evidence of long-range dependence (LRD)
and nonlinear warming trends. The significance of these trends is tested against climate noise. Three different
methods are used to generate climate noise: (i) a short-range-dependent autoregressive process of first order
[AR(1)], (ii) an LRD model, and (iii) phase scrambling. It is found that the ability to distinguish the observed
warming trend from stochastic trends depends on the model representing the background climate variability.
Strong evidence is found of a significant warming trend at Faraday-Vernadsky that cannot be explained by any of
the three null models. The authors find moderate evidence of warming trends for the Stockholm and CET time
series that are significant against AR(1) and phase scrambling but not the LRD model. This suggests that the
degree of significance of climate trends depends on the null model used to represent intrinsic climate variability.
This study highlights that in statistical trend tests, more than just one simple null model of intrinsic climate variability
should be used. This allows one to better gauge the degree of confidence to have in the significance of trends.},

abstract = {The marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical seas and is an important contributor to global N and C cycling. We sought to characterize metabolic uptake patterns in individual Trichodesmium IMS-101 cells by quantitatively imaging ¹³C and ¹⁵N uptake with high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Trichodesmium fix both CO₂ and N₂ concurrently during the day and are, thus, faced with a balancing act: the O₂ evolved during photosynthesis inhibits nitrogenase, the key enzyme in N₂ fixation. After performing correlated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and NanoSIMS analysis on trichome thin-sections, we observed transient inclusion of ¹⁵N and ¹³C into discrete subcellular bodies identified as cyanophycin granules. We speculate that Trichodesmium uses these dynamic storage bodies to uncouple CO₂ and N₂ fixation from overall growth dynamics. We also directly quantified both CO₂ and N₂ fixation at the single cell level using NanoSIMS imaging of whole cells in multiple trichomes. Our results indicate maximal CO₂ fixation rates in the morning, compared with maximal N₂ fixation rates in the afternoon, bolstering the argument that segregation of CO₂ and N₂ fixation in Trichodesmium is regulated in part by temporal factors. Spatial separation of N₂ and CO₂fixation may also have a role in metabolic segregation in Trichodesmium. Our approach in combining stable isotope labeling with NanoSIMS and TEM imaging can be extended to other physiologically relevant elements and processes in other important microbial systems.},

abstract = {Studies of the impacts of climate and climate change on biological systems often attempt to correlate ecological responses with basin-scale indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, such correlations, while useful for detecting long-term trends, are unable to provide a mechanism linking the physical environment and ecological processes. Here we evaluate the effects of the NAO on recruitment variability of rocky intertidal invertebrates in the North Atlantic examining two possible climate-related pathways. Using a highly conservative test we interpret associations with the NAO integrated over a season (three months) as an indicator of atmospheric effects on newly settled recruits (NAO3), and the effects of the NAO integrated over six months (NAO6) as an indicator of changes in ocean circulation affecting patterns of larval transport. Through an extensive literature survey we found 13 time series, restricted to southwest Ireland and Britain and comprising five species, that could be used for statistical analysis. Significant correlations with NAO3, our proxy for atmospheric effects, were observed in the south-central domain of our study region (southwest Ireland and south England). Significant correlations with NAO6, the proxy for ocean circulation effects, were detected on southwest Ireland. The associations were detected for three (two barnacles and a topshell) at two sites. These results suggest that the NAO can have effects on the recruitment of intertidal invertebrates through different pathways linked to climate and be distributed heterogeneously in space. Based on previous evidence and the sign and geographic location of significant correlations, we suggest that winter NAO effects are likely to occur as a result of effects on the survival of early life stages settling during spring or through changes in phenology. Our results argue that a combination of modeling and synthesis can be used to generate hypotheses regarding the effects of climate on recruitment and aid in the design of field-based tests of explicit ecological mechanisms.},

abstract = {Global warming is causing ocean warming and acidification. The distribution of Heliocidaris erythrogramma coincides with the eastern Australia climate change hot spot, where disproportionate warming makes marine biota particularly vulnerable to climate change. In keeping with near-future climate change scenarios, we determined the interactive effects of warming and acidification on fertilization and development of this echinoid. Experimental treatments (20-26 degrees C, pH 7.6-8.2) were tested in all combinations for the 'business-as-usual' scenario, with 20 degrees C/pH 8.2 being ambient. Percentage of fertilization was high (>89{\%}) across all treatments. There was no difference in percentage of normal development in any pH treatment. In elevated temperature conditions, +4 degrees C reduced cleavage by 40 per cent and +6 degrees C by a further 20 per cent. Normal gastrulation fell below 4 per cent at +6 degrees C. At 26 degrees C, development was impaired. As the first study of interactive effects of temperature and pH on sea urchin development, we confirm the thermotolerance and pH resilience of fertilization and embryogenesis within predicted climate change scenarios, with negative effects at upper limits of ocean warming. Our findings place single stressor studies in context and emphasize the need for experiments that address ocean warming and acidification concurrently. Although ocean acidification research has focused on impaired calcification, embryos may not reach the skeletogenic stage in a warm ocean.},

abstract = {There are a growing number of level 4 (L4; gap-free gridded) sea surface temperature (SST) products generated by blending SST data from various sources which are available for use in a wide variety of operational and scientific applications. In most cases, each product has been developed for a specific user community with specific requirements guiding the design of the product. Consequently differences between products are implicit. In addition, anomalous atmospheric conditions, satellite operations and production anomalies may occur which can introduce additional differences. This paper describes a new web-based system called the L4 SST Quality Monitor (L4-SQUAM) developed to monitor the quality of L4 SST products. L4-SQUAM intercompares thirteen L4 products with 1-day latency in an operational environment serving the needs of both L4 SST product users and producers. Relative differences between products are computed and visualized using maps, histograms, time series plots and Hovm{\"{o}}ller diagrams, for all combinations of products. In addition, products are compared to quality controlled in situ SST data (available from the in situ SST Quality Monitor, iQUAM, companion system) in a consistent manner. A full history of products statistics is retained in L4-SQUAM for time series analysis. L4-SQUAM complements the two other Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) tools, the GHRSST Multi Product Ensemble (GMPE) and the High Resolution Diagnostic Data Set (HRDDS) systems, documented in part 1 of this paper and elsewhere, respectively. Our results reveal significant differences between SST products in coastal and open ocean areas. Differences of >2°C are often observed at high latitudes partly due to different treatment of the sea-ice transition zone. Thus when an ice flag is available, the intercomparisons are performed in two ways: including and excluding ice-flagged grid points. Such differences are significant and call for a community effort to understand their root cause and ensure consistency between SST products. Future work focuses on including the remaining daily L4 SST products, accommodating for newer L4 SSTs which resolve the diurnal variability and evaluating retrospectively regenerated L4 SSTs to support satellite data reprocessing efforts aimed at generating improved SST Climate Data Records.},

abstract = {In the present paper, we have carried out analysis of surface chlorophyll-a concentration in the seas around India obtained using the Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-P4 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data. The focus was given to southwest Bay of Bengal where such studies are scanty. The study portraits the chlorophyll-a pattern during July 1999-June 2000. The monthly sea surface temperature (SST) trend and wind patterns using NOAA-NCEP and Quickscat Scatterometer data, respectively, were studied, to elucidate their impact on chlorophyll distribution. This helped to decipher how the reversing monsoon wind induces algal blooming in the surface waters of the study area. Several features like eddies, algal blooms and coastal plumes were observed. Highest mean chlorophyll was observed in January (northeast monsoon) and lowest in May (summer inter monsoon). Adjacent Arabian Sea water found predominantly productive than the Bay of Bengal water. Higher wind speed around 10 m/s in southwest and northeast monsoon shows about two fold increase in chlorophyll concentration to 1.0-2.0 mg/m(3) and the SST has shown gradient and decrease of about 1-2 degrees C in the BoB and off southern India, respectively.},

abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were measured in 157 fish bone collagen samples from 15 different archaeological sites in Belgium which ranged in ages from the 3rd to the 18th c. AD. Due to diagenetic contamination of the burial environment, only 63 specimens produced results with suitable C:N ratios (2.9–3.6). The selected bones encompass a wide spectrum of freshwater, brackish, and marine taxa (N = 18), and this is reflected in the $\delta$13C results (−28.2‰ to −12.9{\%}). The freshwater fish have $\delta$13C values that range from −28.2‰ to −20.2‰, while the marine fish cluster between −15.4‰ and −13.0‰. Eel, a catadromous species (mostly living in freshwater but migrating into the sea to spawn), plots between −24.1‰ and −17.7‰, and the anadromous fish (living in marine environments but migrating into freshwater to spawn) show a mix of freshwater and marine isotopic signatures. The $\delta$15N results also have a large range (7.2‰ to 16.7‰) indicating that these fish were feeding at many different trophic levels in these diverse aquatic environments. The aim of this research is the isotopic characterization of archaeological fish species (ecology, trophic level, migration patterns) and to determine intra-species variation within and between fish populations differing in time and location. Due to the previous lack of archaeological fish isotope data from Northern Europe and Belgium in particular, these results serve as an important ecological backdrop for the future isotopic reconstruction of the diet of human populations dating from the historical period (1st and 2nd millennium AD), where there is zooarchaeological and historical evidence for an increased consumption of marine fish.},

Because of the proximity to the land, image geolocation and careful pixel selection were crucial. The mean annual cycle shows the influence of both air–sea heat flux in the shallow waters and the seasonal strengthening of the tropical Leeuwin Current. Self‐recording temperature loggers were installed on near‐surface buoys for a few months in 2001 to assess how reliably the satellite temperatures could be used in such a dynamic nearshore environment. About 80{\%} of the individual satellite temperatures were within ±0.5°C of the logger measurements (at the same time of day) and over 95{\%} were within ±1°C. Occasio...},

abstract = {Abstract We examined the hypothesis that nutrients from land sources are enhancing the food supply for fish in coastal reefs of northwestern Cuba. Spatial variation in stable isotope ratios ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) was investigated at two sites heavily impacted by mixed pollution sources in Havana City, Cuba, and two reference sites. Significant differences in isotope signatures were found among sites for territorial species, e.g., $\delta$15N was consistently enriched at impacted sites. The most plausible explanation is enriched nitrogen and carbon sources in the food web derived from organic pollution of the coastal zone by human wastewaters. This supports earlier findings that fish were larger in the vicinity of the harbor because of nutrient additions due to sewage that can increase ecosystem productivity and enhance growth of fish. It is also evidence of the direct land-to-water linkage in coastal zone food webs and illustrates how additional nutrients may affect marine food web functions.},

abstract = {Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6°C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

abstract = {The biochemical effects of a cold-core eddy that was shed from the Kuroshio Current at the Luzon Strait bordering the South China Sea (SCS) were studied in late spring, a relatively unproductive season in the SCS. The extent of the eddy was determined by time-series images of SeaWiFS ocean color, AVHRR sea surface temperature, and TOPEX/Jason-1 sea surface height anomaly. Nutrient budgets, nitrate-based new production, primary production, and phytoplankton assemblages were compared between the eddy and its surrounding Kuroshio and SCS waters. The enhanced productivity in the eddy was comparable to wintertime productivity in the SCS basin, which is supported by upwelled subsurface nitrate under the prevailing Northeastern Monsoon. There were more Synechococcus, pico-eucaryotes, and diatoms, but less Trichodesmium in the surface water inside the eddy than outside. Prochlorococcus and Richelia intracellularis showed no spatial differences. Water column-integrated primary production (IPP) inside the eddy was 2-3 times that outside the eddy in the SCS (1.09 vs. 0.59 g C m(-2) d(-1)), as was nitrate-based new production (INP) (0.67 vs. 0.25 g C m(-2) d(-1)). INP in the eddy was 6 times that in the Kuroshio (0.12 g C m(-2) d(-1)). IPP and INP in the eddy were higher than the maximum production values ever measured in the SCS basin. Surface chlorophyll a concentration (0.40 mg m(-3)) in the eddy equaled the maximum concentration registered for the SCS basin and was higher than the wintertime average (0.29 +/- 0.04 mg m(-3)). INP was 3.5 times as great and IPP was doubled in the eddy compared to the wintertime SCS basin. As cold core eddies form intermittently all year round as the Kuroshio invades the SCS, their effects on phytoplankton productivity and assemblages are likely to have important influences on the biogeochemical cycle of the region.},

Here, we evaluate different conceptual approaches to the spatial scaling of beta diversity, interpreted from 'fixed' and 'varying' perspectives of spatial grain and extent. We argue that a 'sliding window' perspective, in which spatial grain and extent covary, is an informative way to conceptualize community differentiation across scales. This concept more realistically reflects the varying empirical approaches that researchers adopt in field sampling and the varying scales of landscape perception by different organisms. Scale dependence in beta diversity has broad implications for emerging fields in ecology and biogeography, such as the integration of fine-resolution ecogenomic data with large-scale macroecological studies, as well as for guiding appropriate management responses to threats to biodiversity operating at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Classic marine ecological paradigms view kelp forests as inherently temperate-boreal phenomena replaced by coral reefs in tropical waters. These paradigms hinge on the notion that tropical surface waters are too warm and nutrient-depleted to support kelp productivity and survival. We present a synthetic oceanographic and ecophysiological model that accurately identifies all known kelp populations and, by using the same criteria, predicts the existence of >23,500 km(2) unexplored submerged (30- to 200-m depth) tropical kelp habitats. Predicted tropical kelp habitats were most probable in regions where bathymetry and upwelling resulted in mixed-layer shoaling above the depth of minimum annual irradiance dose for kelp survival. Using model predictions, we discovered extensive new deep-water Eisenia galapagensis populations in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos that increased in abundance with increasing depth to >60 m, complete with cold-water flora and fauna of temperate affinities. The predictability of deep-water kelp habitat and the discovery of expansive deep-water Gal{\'{a}}pagos kelp forests validate the extent of deep-water tropical kelp refugia, with potential implications for regional productivity and biodiversity, tropical food web ecology, and understanding of the resilience of tropical marine systems to climate change.},

@article{Hutchings2009,
abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19-34°S), which itself is subdivided at 26°S by the powerful Luderitz upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history cycle. While the "Bakun triad" of factors responsible for the development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment, concentration and retention) provide an important unifying principle for understanding the compromise implicit in adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the 1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during the period 1970-1990, while hake have never fully recovered from intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz-Orange River Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone. A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990 and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front. Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5 years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history patterns of these two species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new approach for biogeography to find patterns of sympatry, based on network analysis, is proposed. Biogeographic analysis focuses basically on sympatry patterns of species. Sympatry is a network (= relational) datum, but it has never been analyzed before using relational tools such as Network Analysis. Our approach to biogeographic analysis consists of two parts: first the sympatry inference and second the network analysis method (NAM). The sympatry inference method was designed to propose sympatry hypothesis, constructing a basal sympatry network based on punctual data, independent of a priori distributional area determination. In this way, two or more species are considered sympatric when there is interpenetration and relative proximity among their records of occurrence. In nature, groups of species presenting within-group sympatry and between-group allopatry constitute natural units (units of co-occurrence). These allopatric units are usually connected by intermediary species. The network analysis method (NAM) that we propose here is based on the identification and removal of intermediary species to segregate units of co-occurrence, using the betweenness measure and the clustering coefficient. The species ranges of the units of co-occurrence obtained are transferred to a map, being considered as candidates to areas of endemism. The new approach was implemented on three different real complex data sets (one of them a classic example previously used in biogeography) resulting in (1) independence of predefined spatial units; (2) definition of co-occurrence patterns from the sympatry network structure, not from species range similarities; (3) higher stability in results despite scale changes; (4) identification of candidates to areas of endemism supported by strictly endemic species; (5) identification of intermediary species with particular biological attributes.},

These results can only be explained if terpenes are synthesized by the host. Cultured zooxanthellae, isolated from symbiotic associations, do not make terpenes. Algal sterols of the various sets do not all have the same delta 13C value: average values range from -18.2 to -24.3{\%}.

There is a statistically significant negative trend of up to 0.5 °C per decade in the southern Benguela from January to August, and a cooling trend of lesser magnitude along the South Coast and in the Port Elizabeth/Port Alfred region from May to August. The cooling is due to an increase in upwelling-favourable south-easterly and easterly winds. There is a positive trend in SST of up to 0.55 °C per decade in most parts of the Agulhas Current system during all months of the year, except for KwaZulu-Natal where warming is in summer. The warming was attributed to an intensification of the Agulhas Current in response to a poleward shift of westerly winds and an increase in trade winds in the South Indian Ocean at relevant latitudes. This intensification of the Agulhas Current could also have contributed to the coastal cooling in the Port Alfred dynamic upwelling region. T...},

WRF is also used to test the sensitivity of model simulations to different urban land use scenarios and urban building structures to investigate the impacts of urbanization on surface weather and boundary layer structures. Results show that the coupled WRF/Noah/UCM modeling system seems to be able to reproduce the following observed features reasonably well: 1) the diurnal variation of UHI intensity; 2) the spatial distribution of UHI in Beijing; 3) the diurnal variation of wind speed and direction, and interactions between mountain–valley circulations and UHI; 4) small-scale boundary layer conv...},

The survey focused on gas exchange reactions and chlorophyll a fluorescence in geophytes with different leaf orientation in relation to environmental variability. Although the above ground life cycle of geophytes can be extremely short, unlike desert annuals, they are not characterized by a high photosynthetic CO₂ uptake. Maximum CO₂ uptake ranged from 4 to 20 $\mu$mol CO₂ {\$}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}\backslash\backslashtext{\{}s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} . Temperature optima of photosynthetic CO₂ uptake were comparably low and ranged from 12 to 22°C for eleven species tested, with only one species above 19°C. The decrease of CO₂ uptake with rising temperatures was associated with a substantial increase of photorespiration. Net photosynthesis was saturated between 500 and 900 $\mu$mol photons {\$}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}\backslash\backslashtext{\{}s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} while electron transport through PSII was saturated at higher photon flux densities. At light intensities beyond saturation, a high variability of PSII efficiency occurred. It was highest for horizontal leaves and lowest for upright leaves. However, the maximum quantum yield of PSII ( {\$}\backslashtext{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}v{\}}/\backslashtext{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}m{\}}{\$} ) remained constant during the course of a day, regardless of leaf orientation. This indicates the absence of photoinhibitory effects and a well protected photosynthetic apparatus. Leaf orientation determined interception of solar radiation and thus leaf temperature which was highest for horizontal leaves. In conclusion, Namaqualand geophytes show photosynthetic characteristics that are well adapted to the mild and generally moist conditions during the growing season., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

abstract = {An area of endemism is defined by the spatial congruence among two or more species with distributions that are limited by barriers. In this study, we explored and discussed the use of the network analysis method (NAM) and neighbor-joining (NJ) to analyze the areas of endemism of Quercus sect. Lobatae (red oak species) in Mexico and Central America. We compared the NAM and NJ with other methods commonly used in biogeographic studies to show the advantages of these new approaches and to identify the shortcomings of other approaches. The NAM used in this study is based on notions of centrality measures, such as betweenness. We incorporated the strength of the ties within the internal networks through p-cores and aggregate constraints in iterative analyses. The NAM based on betweenness is ideal for recognizing completely allopatric areas of endemism. The iterative NAMs increase the number of possible areas of endemism because they minimize the effect of minimal overlap, and the p-core is efficient at identifying the closest relationships among species in the cases in which betweenness is not informative. The number of areas of endemism increases when the sympatry matrix minimizes the dispersal effect and the sample effort is maximized, allowing the identification of the greatest number of these areas. The NJ method supports the idea that areas diverge among themselves in a differential way; the long branches correspond to zones with high speciation rates and complex histories (biotic and tectonic), and the short branches correspond to zones with low speciation rates and simple histories. In a classification scheme, NJ was capable of identifying the areas that are considered biotically complex because of their high speciation rates. The results obtained with the NAM and NJ showed that the physiographic regions of Mexico are not natural units and that many of them are composed of at least two different biotic components.},

abstract = {Rough mountain terrain offers climatic conditions (niches) to plants and animals poorly represented by conventional climate station data. However, the extent to which actual temperatures deviate from those of the freely circulating atmosphere had never been assessed at a landscape level. Here, we quantify thermal life conditions across topographically rich mountain terrain by using a combination of thermal (IR) imagery of surface temperature with data from a large number of miniature data loggers buried at 3cm soil depth. The data obtained from six alpine (Alps) and arctic-alpine slopes (Norway, Sweden, Svalbard) evidence persistent root zone temperatures of 2–4K above air temperature during summer. Surface temperatures show strong positive (2–9K) and negative (3–8K) deviations from air tempera- ture on bright days and clear nights, respectively. As to be expected, south oriented slopes are warmer than west and north slopes but microclimatic variation on clear sky days was strong within all slopes, with 8.4 2.5K (mean SD) surface temperature differences persisting over several hours per day along horizontal (i.e., equal elevation) transects. Life conditions of alpine organisms are thus strongly decoupled from conditions in the free atmosphere and cannot reliably be inferred from climate station data in both, temperate and arctic latitudes. Microtopography can mimic temperature differences of large elevational (or latitudinal) gradients over very short horizontal distances. This is important in the context of climate change because it shows that species do not necessarily need to climb several hundred meters in elevation to escape the warmth. Quite often, few meters of horizontal shift will do. For plants unable to, or too slow to adapt to a warmer climate, thermal microhabitat mosaics offer both refuge habitats as well as stepping stones as atmospheric temperatures rise},

abstract = {Changes in plant species richness and community composition were investigated across a fence separating heavily grazed communal and lightly grazed commercial farming systems in Namaqualand, South Africa. No significant differences in plant species richness between communal and commercial farming systems were detected either locally within individual plots or overall across all plots. Within-plot, richness of species tolerant of grazing, such as annuals and geophytes, has increased, while the richness of large palatable shrub species has decreased on the communal rangeland. In terms of plant cover, species' responses to grazing were strongly associated with growth form. Annuals and geophytes formed the majority of grazing increasers, while large, presumably palatable, shrubs and leaf succulents were characteristic grazing decreasers. An investigation into population processes of five shrub species revealed that heavy grazing on the communal rangeland has resulted in: reduced size of palatable shrub species; reduced flower production and seedling recruitment of palatable species; increased density and recruitment of the unpalatable shrub, Galenia africana. Reductions in shrub volume, reproductive output and seedling recruitment were most marked in the palatable shrub Osteospermum sinuatum and were in the order of 90{\%}. The results are further discussed in terms of their relevance to rangeland dynamics and the current land use practices of the region., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

@article{Martin1994,
abstract = {The physiological ecology of members of the Bromeliaceae is reviewed with an emphasis on photosynthesis and water relations. Terrestrial and epiphytic species are, for the most part, treated separately. Water relations, photosynthetic pathways, and photosynthetic responses to light, temperature, drought, atmospheric moisture, elemental nutrients, and pollutants are considered from an ecological perspective. In addition, appendices provide values of numerous ecophysiological parameters for all species studied thus far. Results of this review include the following: (1) the ecophysiology of terrestrial and epiphytic species is surprisingly similar; (2) approximately two-thirds of bromeliads are CAM plants and occupy arid sites or are epiphytic; (3) many species are adapted to full or partial shade, yet can grow in full sunlight; (4) photosynthesis is optimal when day temperatures are warm and night temperatures are cool; (5) species with heavy trichome indumenta on their leaf surfaces are capable of absorbing atmospheric water vapor, yet improvement of tissue water relations is unlikely; (6) heavy trichome covers also suppress CO2 exchange when leaf surfaces are wetted; (7) high levels of recycling of respiratory CO2 via CAM occur in many species, especially under stress; and (8) tissue osmotic and water potentials of nearly all bromeliads investigated are seldom more negative than -1.0 MPa. A potential explanation of the mechanisms underlying maintenance of high tissue water potentials despite large water losses during droughts is discussed. In summary, the diversity of physiological adaptations to the environment in the few bromeliads studied thus far is impressive, but likely will be surpassed with investigation of more species in the Bromeliaceae.},

abstract = {1. Mean body mass (W) and mean numerical (N) or biomass (B) abundance are frequently used as variables to describe populations and species in macroecological and food web studies. 2. We investigate how the use of mean Wand mean N or B, rather than other measures of Wand/or accounting for the properties of all individuals, can affect the outcome of tests of macroecological and food web theory. 3. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that mean W, W at maximum biomass ( {\$}W{\_}{\{}mb{\}}{\$} ), W when energy requirements are greatest ( {\$}W{\_}{\{}me{\}}{\$} ) and the W when a species uses the greatest proportion of the energy available to all species in a W class ( {\$}W{\_}{\{}mpe{\}}{\$} ) are not consistently related. 4. For a population at equilibrium, relationships between mean W and {\$}W{\_}{\{}me{\}}{\$} depend on the slope b of the relationship between trophic level and W. For marine fishes, data show that b varies widely among species and thus mean W is an unreliable indicator of the role of a species in the food web. 5. Two different approaches, 'cross-species' and 'all individuals' have been used to estimate slopes of abundance-body mass relationships and to test the energetic equivalence hypothesis and related theory. The approaches, based on relationships between (1) log10 mean W and log10 mean Nor B, and (2) log10 W and log10 Nor B of all individuals binned into log10 Wclasses (size spectra), give different slopes and confidence intervals with the same data. 6. Our results show that the 'all individuals' approach has the potential to provide more powerful tests of the energetic equivalence hypothesis and role of energy availability in determining slopes, but new theory and empirical analysis are needed to explain distributions of species relative abundance at W. 7. Biases introduced when working with mean W in macroecological and food web studies are greatest when species have indeterminate growth, when relationships between W and trophic level are strong and when the range of species' W is narrow.},

Leaf size classes and leaf consistency types of the woody species in the riverine forest were determined for each community. Analysis of these data revealed a diversification of leaf sizes as the climate changed from temperate to hot and arid and particularly microphylls became relatively less important and were replaced by smaller leaves in the hot areas. In the same direction malacophylls, which are of the "low-cost, quick-profit" strategy type and are well represented in the temperate, frosty areas, disappear and xeromorphic leaves ("high-cost, slow-profit" strategy type) increase in importance. It is suggested that the cooler conditions with higher wind speeds and higher degrees of average air humidity near the Atlantic coast are reflected by an increase in mesophylls which are sclerophyllous as an adaptation to the frequently and rapidly changing temperature conditions here.},

abstract = {Understanding the responses of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) to actual and predicted summer conditions is essential to determine the future sustainability of cork oak woodlands in Iberia. Thermal imaging may provide a rapid method for monitoring the extent of stress. The ecophysiology of cork trees was studied over three years. Three treatments were applied by means of rainfall capture and irrigation, with plots receiving 120{\%}, 100{\%}, or 80{\%} of natural precipitation. Despite stomatal closure, detected using both thermal imaging and porometry, leaf water potential fell during the summer, most drastically during the third year of accumulative stress. The quantum efficiency ($\Phi$PSII) and the maximum efficiency Fv' /FM' of photosystem II also fell more intensely over the third summer, while non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) increased. The reduced precipitation treatment sporadically further reduced leaf water potential, stomatal conductance (gs), IG (an index of gs derived from thermal imaging), $\Phi$PSII, and Fv' /FM', and increased leaf temperature and NPQ. It is concluded that these are very resilient trees since they were only severely affected in the third year of severe drought (the third year registering 45{\%} less rainfall than average), and removing 20{\%} of rainfall had a limited impact..},

abstract = {A near-continuous series of global retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST) has been made from the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series of instruments from 1991 to 2005. To analyze possible long-term trends in the global or regional SST throughout the period daily anomalies are computed using a 1961-90 daily climatology, averaged into global monthly means, and plotted as a global time series. To evaluate anv biases in these anomalies they are compared with other satellite SST datasets that have been computed and compared over the same time period. Global infrared satellite SST data have been received from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) series, microwave SST data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), and global microwave SST data from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Radiometer (AMSR)-E on Aqua. Additionally, the anomalies have also been compared with the Hadley Centre Global Sea lee Coverage and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISSTI) anomalies. HadISSTI is a globally complete 1 degrees SST analysis compiled from in situ and biascorrected AVHRR SSTs at the Met Office (UK).The results of the study show the high accuracy of the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SSTs, but there are concerns with the NOAA-14 AVHRR data (1996-2000) being biased cold, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, and the AMSR-E SSTs (version 4), which show unexplained biases. Since 1999 TMI SSTs appear to have a consistently warm (similar to 0.2 K) bias relative to the infrared sensors and HadISSTI.The time series in (A)ATSR SSTs indicate the possibility of warming trends between 0.1 and 0.2 K decade(-1). but the remaining ATSR(-1) data are required to confirm this.},

Gridded sea surface temperature (SST) products, based on a combination of satellite and in situ observations, can be used to examine variability and long-term trends because they provide better spatial coverage than the limited sets of long in situ time-series. SST data from three gridded products (Reynolds/NCEP OISST.v2., Reynolds ERSST.v3, and the Hadley Centre HadISST1) are compared with long time-series of in situ measurements from ICES standard sections in the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas. The variability and trends derived from the two data sources are examined, and the usefulness of the products as a proxy for subsurface conditions is discussed.},

abstract = {The nearest-neighbour technique is used to infer competition and facilitation between the three most abundant species in a semi-arid region of western South Africa. Relationships among the shrubs Leipoldtia schultzei and Ruschia robusta, which are leaf-succulent members of the Mesembryanthemaceae ('mesembs') and Hirpicium alienatum a non-succulent Asteraceae, were compared on two adjacent sites with different histories of browsing intensity. Competition was more prevalent and more important than facilitation. The only evidence for facilitation was found at the heavily-browsed site where the palatable Hirpicium was larger under the unpalatable Leipoldtia. Generally the prevalence and importance of competition was reduced at the heavily-browsed site. Strong evidence was obtained for intraspecific competition in each of the three species; also, competition was evident between the two mesembs, where Leipoldtia was competitively dominant over Ruschia, although neither species inhibited Hirpicium. Minimal competition between the mesembs and the asteraceous shrub was interpreted in terms of differentiation in rooting depth, and competition within the mesembs, in terms of overlap in rooting depth. The mesembs had the bulk of their roots in the top 5 cm of soil, while the asteraceous shrub had the bulk of its roots, and all its fine roots, at greater depths. The shallow-rooted morphology of the mesembs is well adapted to utilize small rainfall events, which occur frequently in the Succulent Karoo, and do not penetrate the soil deeply. Modifications of existing methods are applied for analysing nearest-neighbour interactions.},

Comparisons of carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) stable isotope ratios of muscle with adipose and caudal fin of two salmonids, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), revealed that caudal fin can be used as a non-destructive surrogate for muscle in stable isotope analysis, but that adipose fin, where available, is a better proxy.

abstract = {Ocean turbulence dissipation rate is estimated either by means of microstructure shear measurements, or by adiabatically reordering vertical profiles of density. The latter technique leads to the estimate of the Thorpe scale, which in turn can be used to obtain average turbulence dissipation rate by comparing the Thorpe scale to the Ozmidov scale. In both cases, the turbulence dissipation rate can be estimated using single vertical profiles from shipborne instrumentation. We present here an alternative method to estimate the length scale of overturns by using the Ellison length scale. The Ellison scale is estimated from temperature variance just beyond the internal wave band, measured by moored instruments. We apply the method to high resolution temperature data from two moorings deployed at different locations around the Josephine seamount (North Eastern Atlantic Ocean), in a region of bottom-intensified turbulence. The variance of the temperature time series just above the internal wave frequency band is well correlated with the Thorpe scale. The method is based on the time--frequency decomposition of variance called "maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform". The results show that the Ellison length scale can be a viable alternative to the Thorpe scale for indirectly estimating turbulence dissipation rate from moored instruments in the ocean if time resolution is sufficiently high. We suggest that fine structure contaminated temperature measurements can provide reliable information on turbulence intensity.},

abstract = {Ecoregionalization of the ocean is a necessary step for spatial management of marine resources. Previous ecoregionalization efforts were based either on the distribution of species or on the distribution of physical and biogeochemical properties. These approaches ignore the dispersal of species by oceanic circulation that can connect regions and isolates others. This dispersal effect can be quantified through connectivity that is the probability, or time of transport between distinct regions. Here a new regionalization method based on a connectivity approach is described and applied to the Mediterranean Sea. This method is based on an ensemble of Lagrangian particle numerical simulations using ocean model outputs at 1/12° resolution. The domain is divided into square subregions of 50 km size. Then particle trajectories are used to quantify the oceanographic distance between each subregions, here defined as the mean connection time. Finally the oceanographic distance matrix is used as a basis for a hierarchical clustering. 22 regions are retained and discussed together with a quantification of the stability of boundaries between regions. Identified regions are generally consistent with the general circulation with boundaries located along current jets or surrounding gyres patterns. Regions are discussed in the light of existing ecoregionalizations and available knowledge on plankton distributions. This objective method complements static regionalization approaches based on the environmental niche concept and can be applied to any oceanic region at any scale.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: For rocky intertidal organisms, temperature is often considered the most influential factor governing early survival and growth. Nevertheless, our review of the literature revealed that few studies have manipulated temperatures in the field to test for effects on these critical early life history processes. Here, we present the results from a novel manipulation of substratum temperature using settlement plates of different colour (black, grey and white) and infrared measurements of temperature to test hypotheses that temperature influences the early survival and growth of recent settlers of the intertidal barnacle Tesseropora rosea. Mean surface temperatures of black and grey plates were as great as 5.8°C (on average 2.2°C) and 4.8°C (on average 1.6°C) hotter than white plates across the sampling period, respectively. Cooler, white plates had significantly greater settlement and early growth than hotter, black plates, but differences in plate temperature did not significantly influence early survival or recruitment, though patterns were consistent with thermal variability. Comparisons between grey coloured natural rock and plates indicate that grey plates thermally mimic natural rock. Nevertheless, on average, more than twice as many larvae settled on plates than on natural rock, but early post-settlement survival on natural rock was double that on plates, suggesting that this artificial surface may not adequately capture the natural variability in early life history processes. Regardless, our simple and repeatable thermal manipulation represents a useful tool for experimentally investigating the effects of temperature on recruitment processes and simulating future temperature variability associated with climate change.},

abstract = {Pachypodium namaquanum (Nyley ex Harb.) Welw., an unusual arborescent stem succulent from the succulent karoo of the arid Richtersveld in north-western South Africa and adjacent Namibia, is characterized by a striking curvature of the terminal 20-60 cm of the trunk toward the north. This orientation displays the single terminal whorl of drought-deciduous leaves with their flat surface angled at a mean inclination of 55° from horizontal. Inclination of 50-60° was found in 65{\%} of individuals sampled, and 85{\%} were inclined between 45 and 65°. Northward azimuth was also quite regular, but varied slightly between populations. The fixed leaf orientation in P. namaquanum maximizes radiation absorption during the winter months when leaves are present. Leaves normally form in early fall (April) and abscise early in spring (October). Growing season conditions in the Richtersveld are relatively mild, with mean maximum temperature dropping only to 21.6°C in July, the coldest month of the year. Frosts are rare. By the fixed orientation of its leaf whorl, P. namaquanum is able to maintain nearly twice the midwinter radiation absorptance that it would have with horizontal orientation. Over an annual cycle the angled leaves receive more radiation than would horizontal leaves for each of the 6 months in which they are present on the plant. This increased winter irradiance is hypothesized to significantly increase net primary production by concentrating growth activities in winter months and allowing the species to remain dormant during the hyperarid conditions of the hot summer months. Midwinter flowering from apical buds in P. namaquanum may also be aided by its stem orientation. The evolution of this characteristic pattern of winter growth phenology and nodding stem orientation may have come about because of low but relatively regular autumn precipitation and moderate winter temperatures. Slow and regular growth of P. namaquanum leads to long lifespans which may reach 300 years or more.},

The major contributions of the E-H to this system are at the shorter wavelengths: it is virtually opaque to UV radiation, and transmits approximately 68{\%} of PAR and over 80{\%} of near-infrared (IR). The high reflectance of the chlorenchyma in the near-IR reduces the absorption by the intact plant to less than 40{\%} of incident radiation.},

A restriction of similarity measures is that they are limited to pairwise comparisons even in a multiple-site study. This work presents a multiple-site similarity measure that makes use of information on species shared by more than two sites and avoids the problem of covariance between pairwise similarities in a multiple-site study. Further, we show that our multiple-site similarity measure is related to beta-diversity measures such as Whittaker's beta-diversity. Similarity measures can also be used as descriptors of effective specialization of insects to host species by measuring similarity from host observations. Finally, we show that multiple-site similarity and host specificity are two sides of the same coin.},

abstract = {Spatial turnover in the composition of biological communities is governed by (ecological) Drift, Selection and Dispersal. Commonly applied statistical tools cannot quantitatively estimate these processes, nor identify abiotic features that impose these processes. For interrogation of subsurface microbial communities distributed across two geologically distinct formations of the unconfined aquifer underlying the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State, we developed an analytical framework that advances ecological understanding in two primary ways. First, we quantitatively estimate influences of Drift, Selection and Dispersal. Second, ecological patterns are used to characterize measured and unmeasured abiotic variables that impose Selection or that result in low levels of Dispersal. We find that (i) Drift alone consistently governs ∼25{\%} of spatial turnover in community composition; (ii) in deeper, finer-grained sediments, Selection is strong (governing ∼60{\%} of turnover), being imposed by an unmeasured but spatially structured environmental variable; (iii) in shallower, coarser-grained sediments, Selection is weaker (governing ∼30{\%} of turnover), being imposed by vertically and horizontally structured hydrological factors;(iv) low levels of Dispersal can govern nearly 30{\%} of turnover and be caused primarily by spatial isolation resulting from limited exchange between finer and coarser-grain sediments; and (v) highly permeable sediments are associated with high levels of Dispersal that homogenize community composition and govern over 20{\%} of turnover. We further show that our framework provides inferences that cannot be achieved using preexisting approaches, and suggest that their broad application will facilitate a unified understanding of microbial communities.},

Illustration of the method is provided using performance statistics from two previously published forecast verification studies (snowfall density and convective initiation) and a verification of several new forecast datasets: Storm Prediction Center forecasts of severe storms (nontornadic and tornadic), Hydrometeorological Prediction Center forecasts of heavy precipitation (greater than 12.5 mm in a 6-h period), National Weather Service Forecast Office terminal aviation forecasts (ceiling and visibility), and medium-range ensemble forecasts of 500-hPa height anomalies. The use of such verification metrics in concert with more detailed investigations to advance forecasting is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Nowhere is the species diversity of geophytes greater than in the five mediterranean-climate ecosystems of the world. Of these, the Cape mediterranean zone of South Africa is the most speciose. While the relative diversity and importance of geophytes of all of the other four mediterranean regions of the world drops off sharply as one moves into adjacent winter-rainfall desert regions, geophytes in the semi-arid to arid Succulent Karoo (including Namaqualand) remain a very important component of the flora, both in terms of abundance and diversity (comprising 13 to 29{\%} of the regional floras in this region). Apart from species richness, there are also a number of interesting geophyte growth forms in this region. One unusual growth form is geophytes with flattened leaves that lie prostrate on the soil surface. At least eight families (Amaryllidaceae, Colchicaceae, Eriospermaceae, Geraniaceae, Hyacinthaceae, Iridaceae, Orchidaceae and Oxalidaceae) exhibit this growth form. While this growth form is relatively common in many geophyte lineages in the Succulent Karoo biome and the Cape mediterranean zone (Fynbos biome), and occurs infrequently through the summer-rainfall temperate regions of Africa, it is virtually absent in other regions worldwide. A null hypothesis is that the prostrate leaved trait is a neutral characteristic, however biogeographical data do not support this. A neutral trait would be unlikely to show such a clear pattern of distribution. Several alternative hypotheses on the adaptive significance of this growth form are discussed. These include: avoidance of herbivory, reduction in competition from neighbors, creation of a CO₂ enriched environment below the leaves, reduction of water loss around the roots, reduction of water loss through transpiration, precipitation of dew on the leaves and maintenance of optimal leaf temperatures for growth., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

abstract = {Aim Our aim in this paper is to present the first broad-scale quantification of species abundance for rocky intertidal communities along the Pacific coast of North America. Here we examine the community-level marine biogeographical patterns in the context of formerly described biogeographical regions, and we evaluate the combined effects of geographical distance and environmental conditions on patterns of species similarity across this region. Location Pacific coast of North America. Methods Data on the percentage cover of benthic marine organisms were collected at 67 rocky intertidal sites from south-eastern Alaska, USA, to central Baja California Sur, Mexico. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to evaluate the spatial patterns of species similarity among sites relative to those of previously defined biogeographical regions. Matrices of similarity in species composition among all sites were computed and analysed with respect to geographical distance and long-term mean sea surface temperature (SST) as a measure of environmental conditions. Results We found a high degree of spatial structure in the similarity of intertidal communities along the coast. Cluster analysis identified 13 major community structure 'groups'. Although breaks between clusters of sites generally occurred at major biogeographical boundaries, some of the larger biogeographical regions contained several clusters of sites that did not group according to spatial position or identifiable coastal features. Additionally, there were several outliers - sites that grouped alone or with sites outside their region - for which localized features may play an important role in driving community structure. Patterns of species similarity at the large scale were highly correlated with geographical distance among sites and with SST. Importantly, we found community similarity to be highly correlated with long-term mean SST while controlling for the effects of geographical distance. Main conclusions These findings reveal a high degree of spatial structure in the similarity of rocky intertidal communities of the north-east Pacific, and are generally consistent with those of previously described biogeographical regions, with some notable differences. Breaks in similarity among clusters are generally coincident with known biogeographical and oceanographic discontinuities. The strong correlations between species similarity and both geographical position and SST suggest that both geography and oceanographic conditions have a large influence on patterns of intertidal community structure along the Pacific coast of North America.},

abstract = {The dynamics of information exchange is an important but understudied aspect of collective communication, coordination, and problem solving in a wide range of distributed systems, both physical (e.g., the Internet) and social (e.g., business firms). In this paper, we introduce a model of organizational networks according to which links are added incrementally to a hierarchical backbone and test the resulting networks under variable conditions of information exchange. Our main result is the identification of a class of multiscale networks that reduce, over a wide range of environments, the likelihood that individual nodes will suffer congestion-related failure and that the network as a whole will disintegrate when failures do occur. We call this dual robustness property of multiscale networks "ultrarobustness." Furthermore, we find that multiscale networks attain most of their robustness with surprisingly few link additions, suggesting that ultrarobust organizational networks can be generated in an efficient and scalable manner. Our results are directly relevant to the relief of congestion in communication networks and also more broadly to activities, like distributed problem solving, that require individuals to exchange information in an unpredictable manner.},

@article{Mmonwa2009,
abstract = {Southern African biogeographic boundaries delimit the phylogeographic distribution of some coastal and estuarine invertebrates. This study investigated the impact of these boundaries on the phylogeographic distribution of two intertidal red seaweeds, Gelidium pristoides and Hypnea spicifera using the mitochondrial Cox2-3 spacer and the nuclear ITS1 regions. G. pristoides spores have short distance-dispersal, while long distance-dispersal is more likely in H. spicifera via spores and drifting fertile thallus fragments. Both markers revealed a south-western and south-eastern lineage within G. pristoides but the breaks between lineages do not coincide with any recognised biogeographic limits.
The Cox2-3 spacer revealed a boundary between the two lineages at the Alexandria Coastal Dunefield (ACD) and ITS1 at the Gamtoos-Van Stadens Dunefields (GVD) which is approximately 80km west of the ACD. The minor difference between the two markers regarding location of the phylogeographic boundary is probably due to the dating differences between the two dunefields. The ACD as developed currently is superimposed on the ancient dunefields which formed during the Pleistocene, coinciding with the Cox2-3 spacer sequences divergence which dates back 500,000 - 580,000 years. The GVD formed during the Holocene (6,500 - 4,000 years ago), coinciding with the ITS1 sequences divergence which dates 4,224 - 4,928 years ago.
Thus, these phylogeographic boundaries probably appeared without the influence of biogeographic boundaries, but rather due to the lack of suitable habitat in the dunefields, coupled with short dispersal-distances of the spores. Analysis of the ITS1 and Cox2-3 spacer regions in H. spicifera revealed that the species is characterized by uniform genetic structure along the coastline. This reflects the species`s potential for long range expansion as it inhabits both the intertidal and subtidal zones; and this presumably leads to high gene flow among populations.
The ITS1 sequences showed minimal genetic variation of one substitution between the gametophyte and tetrasporophyte generations within H. spicifera. This suggests the predominance of asexual reproduction, which reduces gene flow and fixes alleles between generations.
ANOSIM and Bray-Curtis cluster analyses showed scale-dependant variation in the abundances of epifauna (mainly amphipod, isopod, mollusc and polychaete species) on G. pristoides. At small local (within site) and large (among sites) scales, there were weak and no structure in epifaunal abundances respectively. However, at larger, biogeographic scales, samples from the same biogeographic region tended to be clustered together. Thus, there was a group containing predominantly south coast samples and a group containing east coast samples mixed with the remaining south coast samples. Such scale-dependant variation in epifaunal abundances is probably due to the effects of factors driving species richness at small local (within site) scales (e.g. wave exposure, seaweed biomass) and at larger, biogeographic scales (e.g. surface sea temperature).
Moreover, at very small (individual samples) scales; there was no correlation between epifauna composition and genotype of the seaweed. Seaweed samples characterized by distinct ITS1 or Cox2-3 spacer sequences did not show any significant differences in epifaunal composition.
Although the distributional pattern of the epifaunal community observed at large biogeographic scale is not clear, it seems to be associated with the biogeographic regions. However, phylogeographic distribution of Gelidium pristoides is not connected to biogeographic regions. Thus, at larger, biogeographic scales, there is no correlation between phylogeographic distribution of G. pristoides and distribution of the associated fauna.},

abstract = {We consider how the flapping of kelp blades may enhance the flux of nutrients to a blade, by stripping away the diffusive sub-layer and renewing the fluid at the blade surface. The surface renewal model explains the degree of flux enhancement observed in previous studies under different flow and flapping conditions. We measured the motion of real kelp blades of Laminaria saccharina, Macrocystis pyrifera, and Nereocystis luetkeana under uni-directional current in a laboratory flume. Observed flapping frequencies coupled with the renewal model, suggest that the flapping of blades in the field has the potential to significantly enhance flux to the blade surface at low current speed, but has little effect on flux at high current speeds.},

abstract = {A summer bather entering a calm sea from the beach may sense alternating warm and cold water. This can be felt when moving forward into the sea ('vertically homogeneous' and 'horizontally different'), but also when standing still between one's feet and body ('vertically different'). On a calm summer-day, an array of high-precision sensors has measured fast temperature-changes up to 1 °C near a Texel-island (NL) beach. The measurements show that sensed variations are in fact internal waves, fronts and turbulence, supported in part by vertical stable stratification in density (temperature). Such motions are common in the deep ocean, but generally not in shallow seas where turbulent mixing is expected strong enough to homogenize. The internal beach-waves have amplitudes ten-times larger than those of the small surface wind waves. Quantifying their turbulent mixing gives diffusivity estimates of 10(-4)-10(-3) m(2) s(-1), which are larger than found in open-ocean but smaller than wave breaking above deep sloping topography.},

abstract = {The effect of environmental conditions, temperature, relative humidity, and light, together with the regulation of PEPC (phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxylase) activity by malate and pH on CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism), was studied in members of the Mesembryanthemaceae in their natural environment, the southern Namib desert. It was found that during a 24 h period the characteristics of PEPC change. Before sunrise the activity is higher when measured at pH 7 than 8. With bright sunlight the activity measured at pH 7 drops to 20{\%} of its pre-sunrise value, the activity only recovers gradually after malate disappearance and stay constant throughout the night. When measured at pH 8, PEPC shows an opposite behavior, i.e., activity increases in bright sunlight and declines as the pH 7 activity increases. A day-night oscillation in the capacity of malate to stimulate or inhibit PEPC was found. During the day malate inhibits about 90{\%} of the PEPC activity at both pH 7 and 8. After sunset there is a sudden decrease in this inhibition and, at pH 8, malate stimulates the activity by 50{\%}. At pH 7 the stimulation was less. Both stomatal conductance and malate formation were found to increase only when the relative humidity at night rose to 80{\%}. Changes in the properties of the PEPC coincided with the exposure to bright sunlight and changes in leaf temperature. The importance of these metabolic and environmental controls on the regulation of CAM in the Mesembryanthemaceae will be discussed.},

South of Africa it retroflects back into the southwest Indian Ocean, transporting relatively warm water into the midlatitudes. Large sensible and latent heat transfers from the Agulhas Current and its retroflection to the atmosphere occur throughout the year, but particularly during winter. This study suggests that the NCEP and ECMWF models tend to underestimate these fluxes because they are unable to adequately represent the air–sea fluxes over the warmest waters in the core of the current. This core is only 80–100 km wide and it is suggested that the SST data used by these models do not have fine enough spatial resolution to properly represent the Agulhas Current and its mesoscale variability.},

abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

abstract = {Information on the effects of global climate change on trends in global fisheries biomass yields has been limited in spatial and temporal scale. Results are presented of a global study of the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) changes over the last 25 years on the fisheries yields of 63 large marine ecosystems (LMEs) that annually produce 80{\%} of the world's marine fisheries catches. Warming trends were observed in 61 LMEs around the globe. In 18 of the LMEs, rates of SST warming were two to four times faster during the past 25 years than the globally averaged rates of SST warming reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. Effects of warming on fisheries biomass yields were greatest in the fast-warming northern Northeast Atlantic LMEs, where increasing trends in fisheries biomass yields were related to zooplankton biomass increases. In contrast, fisheries biomass yields of LMEs in the fast-warming, more southerly reaches of the Northeast Atlantic were declining in response to decreases in zooplankton abundance. The LMEs around the margins of the Indian Ocean, where SSTs were among the world's slowest warming, revealed a consistent pattern of fisheries biomass increases during the past 25 years, driven principally by human need for food security from fisheries resources. As a precautionary approach toward more sustainable fisheries utilization, management measures to limit the total allowable catch through a cap-and-sustain approach are suggested for the developing nations recently fishing heavily on resources of the Agulhas Current, Somali Current, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal LMEs.},

@article{Clarke2001,
abstract = {A further biodiversity index is proposed, based on taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness of species, namely the 'variation in taxonomic distinctness' (VarTD, $\Lambda$+) between every pair of species recorded in a study. It complements the previously defined 'average taxonomic distinctness' (AvTD, $\Delta$+), which is the mean path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of species in the list. VarTD is simply the variance of these pairwise path lengths and reflects the unevenness of the taxonomic tree. For example, a species list in which there are several different orders represented only by a single species, but also some genera which are very species-rich, would give a high $\Lambda$+ by comparison with a list (of equivalent $\Delta$+) in which all species tended to be from different families but the same order. VarTD is shown to have the same desirable sampling properties as AvTD, primarily a lack of dependence of its mean value on the sample size (except for unrealistically small samples). Such unbiasedness is of crucial importance in making valid biodiversity comparisons between studies at different locations or times, with differing or uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort. This feature is emphatically not shared by indices related to species richness and also not by properties of the phylogeny adapted from proposals in other, conservation contexts, such as 'average phylogenetic diversity' (AvPD, $\Phi$+). As with AvTD, the VarTD statistic for any local study can be tested for 'departure from expectation', based on a master taxonomy for that region, by constructing a simulation distribution from random subsets of the master list. The idea can be extended to summarising the joint distribution of AvTD and VarTD, so that values from real data sets are compared with a fitted simulation 'envelope' in a 2 d ($\Delta$+, $\Lambda$+) plot. The methodology is applied to 14 species lists of free-living marine nematodes, and related to a master list for UK waters. The combination of AvTD and VarTD picks out, in different ways, some degraded locations (low $\Delta$+, low to normal $\Lambda$+) and the pristine island fauna of the Scillies (normal $\Delta$+, high $\Lambda$+). The 2 indices are also demonstrated to be measuring effectively independent features of the taxonomic tree, at least for this faunal group (although it is shown theoretically that this will not always be the case). The combination of $\Delta$+ and $\Lambda$+ is therefore seen to provide a statistically robust summary of taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness patterns within an assemblage, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of historical data in the form of simple species lists.},

abstract = {We assessed the effect of geographical distance on insect species turnover in a situation where other major environmental factors, including host plant species, altitude, and climate, were constant. We sampled ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera, Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) from four tree species: Artocarpus altilis, Ficus nodosa, Leea indica and orientalis, at three sites forming a 1000 km transect in lowland rainforests of northern Papua New Guinea. A standardized volume of wood from trunk, branches and twigs was sampled for ambrosia beetles from three individuals of the four tree species at each site. Each tree was killed standing and left exposed to beetle colonization for 20 days prior to sampling. We obtained 12 751 individuals from 84 morphospecies of ambrosia beetles. We surveyed most of the local species richness at each site, predicted by Chao 2 species richness estimates. The similarity of ambrosia beetle communities, estimated by Chao-Sorensen index, was not correlated with their geographical distance. Likelihood analysis and Q-mode analysis using Monte Carlo-generated null distribution of beedes among sites supported the hypothesis that the assemblages of ambrosia beedes at different sites are drawn from the same species pool, regardless of their geographical distance. Tree part (trunk, branch, or twig) was more important predictor of the composition of ambrosia beetle communities than was the host species or geographical location. All three variables, however, explained only a small portion of variability in ambrosia assemblages. The distribution of ambrosia beetles among tree parts, tree species and study sites was mosdy random, suggesting limited importance of host specificity or dispersal limitation.},

abstract = {We studied the spatial structure of benthic and pelagic primary producer biomass over a large region on the west coast of North America, between Baja California del Sur, Mexico (27 degrees N), and Oregon, USA (42 degrees N). The distribution of benthic primary producer biomass was determined from repeated aerial surveys of shallow subtidal kelp stands, and pelagic primary producer biomass, from the long-term average of nearshore chlorophyll a concentrations from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Spatial analyses showed a striking match between the patch scales of kelp stands and chlorophyll a concentrations, with a characteristic length scale of similar to 180 km. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that kelp and phytoplankton biomass were negatively correlated from 0 to 150 km lag distances in the equatorward direction and 0 to 30 km in the poleward direction. Positive correlations at distances longer than the patch scale detected in the spatial analysis indicated that patches of benthic and pelagic biomass were offset in space. A spatial analysis of coastline features and long-term average coastal sea surface temperature anomalies from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) suggested that the spatial structure of benthic and pelagic primary producer biomass was associated with topographic forcing of coastal upwelling. Our results suggest that shoreline geomorphology has strong effects on coastal ecosystems, by altering the spatial distribution of primary producer biomass over characteristic spatial scales.},

abstract = {Abstract Observations from the Oregon, northwest Africa, Peru, and northern California shelves are used to examine the characteristics of the surface boundary layer in coastal regions during the upwelling season. The observations from these four regions yield a consistent picture of the structure of the surface boundary layer. Both CTD and moored observations reveal the presence of surface mixed layers that are typically 0–20 m thick with variability at diurnal and subtidal (periods longer than 36 hours) frequencies. The subtidal surface mixed-layer depth variability scales as u*/(NIf)½, where u* = ($\tau$S/$\rho$0)½ is the shear velocity, NI is the buoyancy frequency below the surface mixed layer, and f is the Coriolis frequency. Surprisingly, this relationship indicates that the subtidal variability of surface mixed-layer depth does not depend strongly on either the surface heat flux or advection of heat, both of which are large in coastal upwelling regions. Within the surface mixed layer the cross-shelf current ...},

abstract = {The Southern African Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (SAfMA) evaluated the relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being at multiple scales, ranging from local through to sub-continental. Trends in ecosystem services (fresh water, food, fuel-wood, cultural and biodiversity) over the period 1990-2000 were mixed across scales. Freshwater resources appear strained across the continent with large numbers of people not securing adequate supplies, especially of good quality water. This translates to high infant mortality patterns across the region. In some areas, the use of water resources for irrigated agriculture and urban-industrial expansion is taking place at considerable cost to the quality and quantity of freshwater available to ecosystems and for domestic use. Staple cereal production across the region has increased but was outstripped by population growth while protein malnutrition is on the rise. The much-anticipated wood-fuel crisis on the subcontinent has not materialized but some areas are experiencing shortages while numerous others remain vulnerable. Cultural benefits of biodiversity are considerable, though hard to quantify or track over time. Biodiversity resources remain at reasonable levels, but are declining faster than reflected in species extinction rates and appear highly sensitive to land-use decisions. The SAfMA sub-global assessment provided an opportunity to experiment with innovative ways to assess ecosystem services including the use of supply-demand surfaces, service sources and sink areas, priority areas for service provision, service 'hotspots' and trade-off assessments.},

The warming is due to an augmentation of its transport in response to an increase in wind stress curl in the South Indian Ocean at relevant latitudes. This causes an increase in the fluxes of salt and heat into the Atlantic Ocean and in the transfer of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, the changes we are witnessing in the region could have far reaching consequences on top of the regional impacts on ecosystem and climate. The increase in wind stress curl is consistent with a poleward shift of westerly wind in the Southern Hemisphere reported by others.},

@article{Rutherford1999a,
abstract = {Projected climate change has been suspected of affecting the biota of conserved nature areas in different and significant ways. Nevertheless, strategic management within some nature conservation agencies appears relatively unprepared for the possible consequences of climate change. National level planning of reserve design networks has also tended to skirt the issue, possibly owing to insufficient analysis. This paper provides a first assessment of the possible effects of climate change on plant diversity within the protected area network of South Africa. A climate change scenario of increased temperature but no change in precipitation resulted in derived optimum growth days increasing in some reserves through increased temperature extending the growing season. In some other reserves optimum growth days declined through greater evapotranspiration. We concentrated on the larger reserves of the latter group for which conditions that are more limiting were predicted. Plant species were evaluated in terms of their critical limits in growth days and minimum temperature. Over a third of the species analysed for one reserve (Augrabies Falls National Park and Melkbosrand) was indicated to become locally extinct with climate change. Another reserve in the region showed fewer than 1{\%} local extinctions. It is clear that although a certain magnitude of climate change is a prerequisite for these extinctions, the rate and number of extinctions depend strongly on the different environmental tolerances of the specific biotic components of the conserved area. Potential immigration of other species to Augrabies Falls/ Melkbosrand required to balance the projected extinctions with climate change would need migration abilities and conditions that are unlikely to be met. A net decrease in plant diversity may thus be expected. The results confirm that with the climate change scenario used, the concept of sustaining species through fixed protected areas may be fundamentally flawed, at least in certain areas., Special Issue: Global Change Effects on Landscape and Regional Patterns of Plant Diversity},

abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon-Wiener and Gini-Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sorensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita-Horn index as special cases.},

The flora comprises ca. 18,500 species in 1,930 genera. There are 10 endemic families, while 80{\%} of the species and 29{\%} of the genera are endemic. Of the five phytogeographic regions recognized, the Cape Floristic Region is the richest and most distinctive, and in this small area there are some 8,550 species in 957 genera. Most of the subcontinent is arid to semiarid. Its rich and diverse flora, contrasting with the relatively depauperate tropical African flora, is believed to have evolved gradually since the early to mid-Tertiary at the southern edge of the tropics as Africa became progressively drier, partly from an ancient southern African temperate flora and partly from a tropical African forest flora. The large number of species in the Cape Region and adjacent arid areas probably evolved recently in the last 1-2 million years as the climate fluctuated violently during the Pleistocene. Peculiarities of the flora include an unusually high proportion of petaloid monocots, a wealth of succulents, mainly in winter rainfall arid areas, large numbers of sclerophyllous to microphyllous shrubs, and very few annuals.},

abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this study is to present a satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) climatology based on Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data and to evaluate it and several other climatologies for their usefulness in the determination of SST trends. The method of evaluation uses two long-term observational collections of in situ SST measurements: the 1994 World Ocean Atlas (WOA94) and the Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set (COADS). Each of the SST climatologies being evaluated is subtracted from each raw SST observation in WOA94 and COADS to produce several separate long-term anomaly datasets. The anomaly dataset with the smallest standard deviation is assumed to identify the climatology best able to represent the spatial and seasonal SST variability and therefore be most capable of reducing the uncertainty in SST trend determinations. The satellite SST climatology was created at a resolution of 9.28 km using both day and night satellite fields generated wit...},

There is only a weak relationship between biogeographic region and timing of reproduction, Nevertheless, a relatively large proportion of west coast species studied breed in winter, whereas south coast species tend to have breeding peaks in spring/summer, although many nearly always have mature gametes and probably reproduce year-round. East coast species are mainly continuous or summer breeders, The factors that control gametogenesis and trigger spawning are largely unresolved, although temperature and food are thought to be important in many species.},

abstract = {The high biological production of the California Current System (CCS) results from the seasonal development of equatorward alongshore winds that drive coastal upwelling. While several climatic fluctuation patterns influence the dynamics and biological productivity of the CCS, including the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), the mechanisms of interaction between climatic oscillations and the CCS upwelling dynamics have remained obscure. Here, we use Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) to reveal, for the first time, low-frequency concordance between the time series of climatic indices and upwelling intensity along the coast of western North America. Based on energy distributions in annual, semiannual and low-frequency signals, we can divide the coast into three distinct regions. While the annual upwelling signal dominates the energy spectrum elsewhere, low-frequency variability is maximal in the regions south of 33°N. Non-structured variability associated with storms and turbulent mixing is enhanced at northerly locations. We found that the low-frequency signal is significantly correlated with different climatic indices such as PDO, NPGO and ENSO with the correlation patterns being latitude-dependent. We also analyzed the correlations between this upwelling variability and sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) throughout the North Pacific to visualize and interpret the large-scale teleconnection dynamics in the atmosphere that drive the low-frequency coastal winds. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms connecting climatic patterns with upwelling dynamics, which could enhance our prediction and forecast capabilities of the effects of future oceanographic and climatic variability in the CCS.},

This region forms part of the species-rich Succulent Karoo biome. In an area of 750 km, 300 plant species were recorded with 24{\%} endemnicity. This level of diversity and endemism is exceptionally high for a desert region. Plant distribution is strongly influenced by habitat type. Diversity, especially of endemic species, was concentrated on rocky or unusual (lag-gravel pavements) habitats. Endemics were not random phylogenetic nor biological assemblages. Dwarf leaf-succulent shrubs, especially Mesembryanthemaceae, were significantly over-represented amongst the endemic component.

After a severe drought in 1979, which caused high plant mortality, perennial species number in a permanent 10 m × 10 m plot doubled between 1980 and 1996, when the maximum of 41 species was recorded. Numbers of individuals of evergreen, leaf succulent shrubs also doubled over the same period, but showed fluctuations in response to dry years during the monitoring period. Detailed observations on the four dominant leaf succulent shrubs (all members of the Mesembryanthemaceae) between 1983 and 1996, showed species-specific patterns in population turnover. Mortality of all observed individuals ranged between 60{\%} and 85{\%}, and the proportion of the population that was recruited over this period ranged from 62{\%} to 89{\%}. In only one species did individuals persist throughout the monitoring period. Mean ages of individuals, excluding seedlings with lifespans of {\&}amp;lt1 yr, and individuals observed at the beginning of the monitoring period, ranged from 4.6 yr to 5.6 yr. Patterns of mortality and recruitment showed substantial differences among species and were not all attributable to rainfall patterns. Overall, the turnover of the shrub populations over the 15-yr monitoring period was remarkably high for a system of desert perennials. These unusual population patterns may explain the unique structure of leaf succulent-dominated communities in the Succulent Karoo., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

abstract = {Rough mountain terrain offers climatic conditions (niches) to plants and animals poorly represented by conventional climate station data. However, the extent to which actual temperatures deviate from those of the freely circulating atmosphere had never been assessed at a landscape level. Here, we quantify thermal life conditions across topographically rich mountain terrain by using a combination of thermal (IR) imagery of surface temperature with data from a large number of miniature data loggers buried at 3cm soil depth. The data obtained from six alpine (Alps) and arctic-alpine slopes (Norway, Sweden, Svalbard) evidence persistent root zone temperatures of 2–4K above air temperature during summer. Surface temperatures show strong positive (2–9K) and negative (3–8K) deviations from air tempera- ture on bright days and clear nights, respectively. As to be expected, south oriented slopes are warmer than west and north slopes but microclimatic variation on clear sky days was strong within all slopes, with 8.4 2.5K (mean SD) surface temperature differences persisting over several hours per day along horizontal (i.e., equal elevation) transects. Life conditions of alpine organisms are thus strongly decoupled from conditions in the free atmosphere and cannot reliably be inferred from climate station data in both, temperate and arctic latitudes. Microtopography can mimic temperature differences of large elevational (or latitudinal) gradients over very short horizontal distances. This is important in the context of climate change because it shows that species do not necessarily need to climb several hundred meters in elevation to escape the warmth. Quite often, few meters of horizontal shift will do. For plants unable to, or too slow to adapt to a warmer climate, thermal microhabitat mosaics offer both refuge habitats as well as stepping stones as atmospheric temperatures rise},

A consistent time-series of daily sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a concentration images is generated for the period July 1998–June 2003, and a quantitative analysis undertaken. The variability in SST, upwelling and phytoplankton biomass is explored for selected biogeographic regions, with particular focus on intra-seasonal time scales. The location and emergence of upwelling cells are clearly identified along the length of the southern Benguela, being distinct on the narrow inner and the mid-continental shelves. Most notable is the rapidly pulsating nature of the upwelling, with intense warm/cold events clearly distinguished. The phytoplankton response to this physical forcing is des...},

This approach, which appears in various forms, is fundamentally flawed. We document that the problem is extensive and present arguments to demonstrate the flaw in the logic.},

abstract = {Understanding spatial variation in biodiversity along environmental gradients is a central theme in ecology. Differences in species compositional turnover among sites ($\beta$ diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in $\beta$ diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that $\beta$ diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness ($\gamma$ diversity), these differences in $\beta$ diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of $\beta$ diversity.},

@article{Tittensor2010a,
abstract = {Global patterns of species richness and their structuring forces have fascinated biologists since Darwin and provide critical context for contemporary studies in ecology, evolution and conservation. Anthropogenic impacts and the need for systematic conservation planning have further motivated the analysis of diversity patterns and processes at regional to global scales. Whereas land diversity patterns and their predictors are known for numerous taxa, our understanding of global marine diversity has been more limited, with recent findings revealing some striking contrasts to widely held terrestrial paradigms. Here we examine global patterns and predictors of species richness across 13 major species groups ranging from zooplankton to marine mammals. Two major patterns emerged: coastal species showed maximum diversity in the Western Pacific, whereas oceanic groups consistently peaked across broad mid-latitudinal bands in all oceans. Spatial regression analyses revealed sea surface temperature as the only environmental predictor highly related to diversity across all 13 taxa. Habitat availability and historical factors were also important for coastal species, whereas other predictors had less significance. Areas of high species richness were disproportionately concentrated in regions with medium or higher human impacts. Our findings indicate a fundamental role of temperature or kinetic energy in structuring cross-taxon marine biodiversity, and indicate that changes in ocean temperature, in conjunction with other human impacts, may ultimately rearrange the global distribution of life in the ocean.},

abstract = {Aim: We assessed the rates of turnover of tree species with distance (beta diversity) in wet forests of the Western Ghats (WG) complex of India to see whether climate, topographic variation or species traits influence beta diversity. Location: The Western Ghats is a chain of mountains about 1600 km in length, running parallel to the western coast of the Indian Peninsula from above 80 N to almost 21° N latitude. Methods: We used data from 60 small plot inventories concentrated in three regions: the southernmost part of the Western Ghats (SWG) (8°24′ to 9°37′ N), the Nilgiri Hills (11°12′ to 11°14′ N), and the central Western Ghats (CWG) (12°32′ to 14°51′ N). We used Sorensen's index (SI) to estimate the similarity in species composition between two plots and regressed SI against the logarithm of the distance between plots to assess beta diversity. A bootstrapping procedure provided confidence intervals for regression coefficients. To test for the effects of climate, we regressed seasonality differences between plots against SI for low-elevation (< 800 m) plots along the north-south axis, and all plots in the SWG. We assessed the impact of the rainfall gradient in the Kogar region. Results: Among all three regions, beta diversity was highest along the latitudinal axis, and along the rainfall gradient in the Kogar region. Differences in seasonality between sites were strongly related to beta diversity along the north-south seasonality gradient and within the SWG. Within the three regions, beta diversity was highest in the region with the strongest rainfall gradient and lowest for the topographically heterogeneous SWG. Beta diversity did not differ between forest strata and dispersal modes. Main conclusions: We conclude that climate, particularly seasonality, is probably the primary driver of beta diversity among rain forest trees of the Western Ghats complex.},

abstract = {The value of stable isotope analysis in tracking animal migrations in marine environments is poorly understood, mainly due to insufficient knowledge of isotopic integration into animal tissues within distinct water masses. We investigated isotopic and moult patterns in Cory's shearwaters to assess the integration of different stable isotopes into feathers in relation to the birds' transoceanic movements. Specimens of Mediterranean Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea diomedea caught accidentally by Catalan longliners were collected and the signatures of stable isotopes of C ($\delta$¹₃C), N ($\delta$¹⁵N) and S ($\delta$³⁴S) were analysed in 11 wing and two tail feathers from 20 birds, and in some breast feathers. Based on isotopic signatures and moult patterns, the feathers segregated into two groups (breeding and wintering), corresponding to those grown in the Mediterranean or Atlantic regions, respectively. In addition, feathers grown during winter, i.e. moulted in Atlantic waters, were grouped into two isotopically distinct profiles, presumably corresponding to the two main wintering areas previously identified for Mediterranean Cory's shearwater in tracking studies. N signatures mainly indicated the Mediterranean-to-Atlantic migration, whereas C and S signatures differed according to the Atlantic wintering area. Our results indicate that isotopic signatures from distant oceanic regions can integrate the feathers of a given bird and can indicate the region in which each feather was grown. This study thus underscores how stable isotope analysis can link marine animals to specific breeding and wintering areas, and thereby shed new light on studies involving assignment, migratory connectivity and carry-over effects in the marine environment.},

abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the biogeographic distribution of seaweeds and is expected to increase due to the rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, especially in polar and cold-temperate regions. To estimate prospective distributional shifts in cold-water key structural seaweeds from both hemispheres, we related temperature requirements and recent distributions of seaweeds to observed mean sea surface temperature (SST) isotherms for the periods 1980–1999 (Meteorological Office Hadley Centre's SST data set; HadISST) and to modelled temperatures for 2080–2099 [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) database prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) report] based on moderate greenhouse gas emissions Special Report on Emission Scenarios – Scenario B1 (SRESA1B). Under this scenario, North Atlantic polar to cold-temperate seaweeds investigated will extend their distribution into the High Arctic until the end of the 21st century, but retreat along the northeastern Atlantic coastline. In contrast, selected Antarctic seaweeds will probably not significantly alter their latitudinal distributions, as deduced from our presently incomplete knowledge of their temperature requirements. We identified several cold-temperate regions where seaweed composition and abundance will certainly change with elevated temperatures. The results are discussed in the context of local temperature conditions, effects of multifactorial abiotic and biotic interactions and expected ecological consequences for seaweed-dominated ecosystems.},

abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are often both leading indicators and important drivers of marine resource fluctuations. Assessment of the skill of SST anomaly forecasts within coastal ecosystems accounting for the majority of global fish yields, however, has been minimal. This reflects coarse global forecast system resolution and past emphasis on the predictability of ocean basin-scale SST variations. This paper assesses monthly to inter-annual SST anomaly predictions in coastal “Large Marine Ecosystems” (LMEs). We begin with an analysis of 7 well-observed LMEs adjacent to the United States and then examine how mechanisms responsible for prediction skill in these systems are reflected in predictions for LMEs globally. Historical SST anomaly estimates from the 1/4o daily Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature reanalysis (OISST.v2) were first found to be highly consistent with in-situ measurements for 6 of the 7 U.S. LMEs. Thirty years of retrospective forecasts from climate forecast systems developed at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (CM2.5-FLOR) and the National Center for Environmental Prediction (CFSv2) were then assessed against OISST.v2. Forecast skill varied widely by LME, initialization month, and lead but there were many cases of high skill that also exceeded that of a persistence forecast, some at leads greater than 6 months. Mechanisms underlying skill above persistence included accurate simulation of a) seasonal transitions between less predictable locally generated and more predictable basin-scale SST variability; b) seasonal transitions between different basin-scale influences; c) propagation of SST anomalies across seasons through sea ice; and d) re-emergence of previous anomalies upon the breakdown of summer stratification. Globally, significant skill above persistence across many tropical systems arises via mechanisms a) and b). Combinations of all four mechanisms contribute to less prevalent but nonetheless significant skill in extratropical systems. While continued refinement of global climate forecast systems and observations are needed to improve coastal SST anomaly prediction and extend predictions to other ecosystem relevant variables (e.g., salinity), present skill warrants close examination of forecasts for marine resource applications.},

abstract = {Plant cover is a fundamental feature of many coastal marine and terrestrial systems and controls the structure of associated animal communities. Both natural and human-mediated changes in plant cover influence abiotic sediment properties and thus have cascading impacts on the biotic community. Using clipping (structural) and light (shading) manipulations in two salt marsh vegetation zones (one dominated by Spartina foliosa and one by Salicornia virginica), we tested whether these plant species exert influence on abiotic environmental factors and examined the mechanisms by which these changes regulate the biotic community. In an unshaded (plant and shade removal) treatment, marsh soils exhibited harsher physical properties, a microalgal community composition shift toward increased diatom dominance, and altered macrofaunal community composition with lower species richness, a larger proportion of insect larvae, and a smaller proportion of annelids, crustaceans, and oligochaetes compared to shaded (plant removal, shade mimic) and control treatment plots. Overall, the shaded treatment plots were similar to the controls. Plant cover removal also resulted in parallel shifts in microalgal and macrofaunal isotopic signatures of the most dynamic species. This suggests that animal responses are seen mainly among microalgae grazers and may be mediated by plant modification of microalgae. Results of these experiments demonstrate how light reduction by the vascular plant canopy can control salt marsh sediment communities in an arid climate. This research facilitates understanding of sequential consequences of changing salt marsh plant cover associated with climate or sea level change, habitat degradation, marsh restoration, or plant invasion.},

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

@article{Caut2008,
abstract = {1. Naturally occurring stable isotopes in resources and their consumer allow the estimation of nutritional flows between the two and have been much used to improve our understanding of the nutritional ecology of free-living animals. 2. The difference in isotopic composition between an animal and its diet is represented by a discrimination factor. Carbon and nitrogen flows are estimated by calculating the discrimination factors in stable isotope ratios ($\delta$ⁱ⁵N and $\delta$ⁱ³C), which are presumed to be c. 3‰ and 1‰ heavier in the consumer tissues than those in their resources, respectively. 3. The discrimination factor is known to vary according to species, tissue, age, growth rates and food quality, but the estimation of discrimination factors is difficult and a fixed discrimination factor is usually used in diet reconstruction. It has also been suggested that discrimination factors could vary linearly with the diet isotopic ratio. If this linear relationship could be demonstrated using regression, this would provide an adequate method for the estimation of discrimination factors. In order to understand how diet isotopic ratios affect the discrimination factor, we investigated the pattern of its change in nitrogen ($\Delta$ⁱ⁵N) and carbon ($\Delta$ⁱ³C) in different tissues (liver, muscle and hair) of an omnivore species, the rat Rattus rattus. We fed captive rats with diets of the same nutritional quality but on different isotopic ratios. 4. First, discrimination factors for $\Delta$ⁱ⁵N and $\Delta$ⁱ³C showed great variability, ranging from -1·46‰ to 4·59‰ and from -8·79‰ to 0·64‰, respectively. Discrimination factors depended on both diet isotopic ratio and tissue. 5. We also show that isotope ratios in shaved hairs showed a turnover during the first month, and then stabilized during the second month. Using shaved hairs has the potential to be an effective non-lethal method for determining resource shifts in non-specialist consumers. 6. Finally, we demonstrated, for all tissues, a decrease of $\Delta$ⁱ⁵N and $\Delta$ⁱ³C with an increased values of $\delta$ⁱ⁵N and $\delta$ⁱ³C, respectively. These relationships allow us to propose a framework to estimate discrimination factors from diet isotopic ratios by means of regression models.},

@book{Zabala1989,
abstract = {[EN] Most structure-building organisms in rocky benthic communities are surface-dependent because their energy inputs depend mainly on the surface they expose to water. Two photosynthetic strategies, divided into calcareous and non calcareous algae, strict suspension-feeders and photosynthetic suspension feeders (e.g. hermatypic corals) are the four main strategies evolutively acquired by benthic organisms. Competition between those strategies occur in relation to productivity of the different species, in such a way that, for given environmental conditions, species with a higher growth (P/B ratio) would dominate. At a worldwide scale, littoral marine benthos can he considered to fit into the four fields defined by two main axes: the first, relates to productivity and relies atrophic and oligotrophic waters and the second is defined by the degree of environmental variability or seasonality (from high to low). Coral reefs (marine ecosystems dominated by photosynthetic suspension feeders) develop in the space of oligotrophic areas with low variability, while kelp beds (marine ecosystem dominated by large, non calcareous algae) are to be found only in eutrophic places with a high variability. The space of eutrophic waters with a low variability do not has specially adapted, high structured, benthic marine ecosystems, and in these conditions opportunistic algae and animals predominate. Finally, photophilic mediterranean benthos -devoid of kelps and without hermatypic corals- typifies the field of oligotrophic areas with high variability; in its more genuine aspect, Mediterranean benthos is represented by small algae with a high percentage of calcareous thallii. In all cases strict suspension-feeders compete successfully with photosynthetic organisms only in situations of low irradiances or very high inputs of POM. In its turn, Mediterranean rocky benthos, in spite of its relative uniformity, is geographically organized along the same axes. The Gulf of Lions and the insular bottoms (Balearic Islands, for example) would correspond to the extremes of eutrophic-high variability areas and oligotrophic-low variability areas, respectively. Irradiance, nutrient and POM concentration, and hydrodynamism are the three variables which mainly affect the distribution of the different surface-dependent strategies, and thus, these parameters are of paramount interest for understanding the trophic structure of Mediterranean benthic communities. In environments non limited by light, nutrient availability, defined as the product between nutrient -POM concentration and hydrodynamism, states the dominance of calcareous versus non calcareous algae. Calcareous algae dominate in oligotrophic waters while non-calcareous algae dominate in moderately eutrophic waters. In light-limited environments, passive suspension feeders (octocorallaria, gorgonians) become dominant species if POM availability is enhanced by a high hydrodynamism (strong currents); in waters with a low charge of POM organisms of other groups, mainly active suspension feeders, predominate (sponges, bryozoans, scleractiniarians). In any case, there always exists a very variable bathymetric zone, depending on light attenuation and nutrient-POM availability, where encrusting calcareous algae strongly compete with suspension feeders (coralligenous).},

@article{Tuomisto2010a,
abstract = {The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called "beta diversity" over the years into a common conceptual framework and to explain what each of them measures. The first part (Tuomisto 2010) discussed basic definitions of "beta diversity". Each arises from a different way of combining a definition of "diversity" with a definition of its alpha component and with a mathematical relationship between the alpha and gamma components. This second part assumes that an appropriate basic definition of a beta component (which may or may not be true beta diversity) has been chosen, and the focus here will be on how to quantify it for a given dataset. About twenty different approaches have been used for this purpose. It turns out that only two of these approaches accurately quantify the selected beta component: one does so for the entire dataset, and the other for two sampling units at a time. The other approaches actually quantify other phenomena, such as mean species turnover between sampling units, compositional gradient length (with or without reference to an external gradient), distinctness of a focal sampling unit, rate of species accumulation with increasing sampling effort, rate of compositional turnover along an external gradient, or the rate of decay in compositional similarity with increasing geographical distance. Although most of these phenomena can be expressed as a function of a beta component of diversity, they do not equal a beta component of diversity. Many of these derived variables are not even numerically correlated with the beta component on which they are based, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting the results. The effects of sampling decisions when results are extrapolated beyond the available data will also be discussed.},

Identified knowledge gaps and research needs include: (i) interaction between changes in air quality (trace gas concentrations), climate and other site factors on forest ecosystem response, (ii) significance of biotic processes in system response, (iii) tools for mechanistic and diagnostic understanding and upscaling, and (iv) the need for unifying modelling and empirical research for synthesis. This position paper highlights the above focuses, including the global dimension of air pollution as part of climate change and the need for knowledge transfer to enable reliable risk assessment. A new type of research site in forest ecosystems ("supersites") will be conducive to addressing these gaps by enabling integration of experimentation and modelling within the soil-plant-atmosphere interface, as well as further model development.},

A significant population has established at Koppie Alleen, De Hoop Nature Reserve, which has been monitored from 2008 to 2011. It is hypothesised that the eastward spread is limited by aspects of the inshore water temperature regime, and recent evidence suggests that gradual cooling along this coast may have caused the change in distribution. It seems likely that if a cooling trend continues along the South African south coast, kelp beds and their associated species will move farther eastward in future decades, affecting the ecology and livelihoods along this coast.},

abstract = {We analyze interannual variation in zooplankton biomass in the southwestern Barents Sea in spring (May) and summer (June-July) 1959-1993. Using a threshold modeling approach, we quantify spatial, climatic, and across-season autoregressive effects under contrasting regimes of low and high densities of planktivorous fish (capelin and herring). Main findings: (1) zooplankton biomass is mainly influenced by capelin feeding, first in the offshore parts of the western Barents Sea in spring and subsequently farther east and north in summer, whereas direct effects of herring are quantitatively less important; (2) effects of climate are stronger during the zooplankton increase phase in spring than in summer and are better predicted using the North Atlantic Oscillation index than using reconstructed sea surface temperature and Atlantic water influx; (3) regional anomalies in zooplankton biomass persist from spring to summer but not from summer to the subsequent spring, indicating that the observed fluctuations have little effect on next year's dynamics; and (4) effects of climatic variation and planktivorous fish interact: climatic (and autoregressive) effects are mainly evident when and where the effect of feeding is weak. Zooplankton dynamics thus appear to be under shifting top-down and climatic control, the relative importance of the two processes varying spatially, seasonally, and interannually.},

@article{Carvalho2013,
abstract = {Beta diversity and nestedness are central concepts of ecology and biogeography and evaluation of their relationships is in the focus of contemporary ecological and conservation research. Beta diversity patterns are originated from two distinct processes: the replacement (or turnover) of species and the loss (or gain) of species leading to richness differences. Nested distributional patterns are generally thought to have a component deriving from beta diversity which is independent of replacement processes. Quantification of these phenomena is often made by calculating a measure of beta diversity, and the resulting value being subsequently partitioned into a contribution by species replacement plus a fraction shared by beta diversity and nestedness. Three methods have been recently proposed for such partitioning, all of them based on pairwise comparisons of sites. In this paper, the performance of these methods was evaluated on theoretical grounds and tested by a simulation study in which different gradients of dissimilarity, with known degrees of species replacement and species loss, were created. Performance was also tested using empirical data addressing land-use induced changes in endemic arthropod communities of the Terceira Island in the Azores. We found that the partitioning of $\beta$ cc (dissimilarity in terms of the Jaccard index) into two additive fractions, $\beta$₋₃ (dissimilarity due to species replacement) plus $\beta$ rich (dissimilarity due to richness differences) reflects the species replacement and species loss processes across the simulated gradients in an ecologically and mathematically meaningful way, whilst the other two methods lack mathematical consistency and prove conceptually self-contradictory. Moreover, the first method identified a selective local extinction process for endemic arthropods, triggered by land-use changes, while the latter two methods overweighted the replacement component and led to false conclusions. Their basic flaw derives from the fact that the proposed replacement and nestedness components (deemed to account for species loss) are not scaled in the same way as the measure that accounts for the total dissimilarity (S{\o}rensen and Jaccard indices). We therefore recommend the use of $\beta$ cc = $\beta$₋₃ + $\beta$ rich , since its components are scaled in the same units and their responses are proportional to the replacement and the gain/loss of species.},

To correct for the effect of the species pool on the estimation of species niche width, Zeleny suggested a modification of the original algorithm by replacing additive partitioning as a measure of beta diversity with Whittaker's beta. 2. We used simulated data to show that the alternative index proposed by Zeleny (2008) will poorly represent the niche widths of species inhabiting a set of plots with a highly skewed distribution of local richness values. We therefore expand on Zeleny's (2008) analysis by considering two additional metrics of beta diversity based on compositional similarity and by testing the performance of these indices under different local-regional richness relationships. 3. Synthesis. None of the four tested metrics of beta diversity produced unbiased estimates of niche width under curvilinear local-regional richness relationships. In this context, we provide additional guidance to potential users of co-occurrence based niche width estimates by specifying the conditions under which certain indices of beta diversity best represent niche width information.},

abstract = {Abstract Prevailing notions of foodweb structure and trophic relations in fresh waters are based on research undertaken in a limited range of latitudes or habitat types. This limitation had led to the general view that stream food webs are detritus-based with short food chains and simple interactions that often are dominated by a few key species. We used gut-content analyses and stable-isotope signatures to characterize feeding relationships and foodweb attributes of benthic communities in riffles in 2 forest streams in Hong Kong. We compared them with existing data on foodweb structure from pools in 1 of the streams and data from the literature. The 2 approaches to dietary analyses yielded complementary results, providing confidence that trophic relations and foodweb structure were adequately characterized. Food webs in both streams were remarkably similar regardless of habitat (riffle vs pool). Consumers in both streams depended primarily on autochthonous resources, as has been reported from some other tropical streams, and food chains were short although connectance was higher than has been recorded previously for stream food webs. Very few omnivores were found, and omnivory was even rarer than is typical of temperate streams, although it is common in other tropical streams and rivers. No evidence was found for dominance by a few common macroconsumer species, as observed elsewhere in the tropics. The apparently high levels of autochthony in tropical running waters imply that models of ecosystem functioning for northern temperate streams are inadequate for describing tropical systems. However, marked differences in the degree of omnivory and dominance of tropical stream food webs by macroconsumers is evidence that characterization of trophic interactions and stream ecosystem functioning cannot be captured by a simple tropical vs temperate dichotomy. Successful management of these systems will depend upon development of conceptual models that reflect the diversity of food webs within and between regions.},

abstract = {Chokka squid biomass and catch are highly variable, likely owing to their links to changes in the ecosystem, which impact spawning and recruitment. A synthesis of basic ecosystem components for the domain in which chokka squid live (i.e. South Africa's west coast and Agulhas Bank) was prepared using published and new data. It included bottom temperature, bottom dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and copepod abundance. Alongshore gradients of these indicated that the main spawning grounds on the eastern Agulhas Bank are positioned where bottom temperature and bottom dissolved oxygen are optimal for embryonic development. This location, however, appears suboptimal for hatchlings because the copepod maximum (food for paralarvae) is typically on the central Agulhas Bank some 200 km to the west. Data on currents suggest that this constraint may be overcome by the existence of a net west-flowing shelf current on the eastern Agulhas Bank, improving survivorship of paralarvae by transporting them passively towards the copepod maximum. CTD data and a temporal analysis of AVHRR satellite imagery reveal the copepod maximum to be supported by a "cold ridge", a mesoscale upwelling filament present during summer when squid spawning peaks. In situ sea surface temperature (SST) data used as a proxy for cold ridge activity demonstrate considerable interannual variability of the feature, especially during El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation events. Negative linear correlations between maximum summer SST (monthly average) and squid biomass the following autumn (r2 = 0.94), and annual catch (r 2 = 0.69), support the link between the "cold ridge-copepod maximum" and the early life cycle of chokka squid, and holds promise for prediction. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Knowledge of broad-scale global patterns in beta diversity (i.e., variation or turnover in identities of species) for marine systems is in its infancy. We analysed the beta diversity of groundfish communities along the North American Pacific coast, from trawl data spanning 32.57°N to 48.52°N and 51 m to 1200 m depth. Analyses were based on both the Jaccard measure and the probabilistic Raup-Crick measure, which accounts for variation in alpha diversity. Overall, beta diversity decreased with depth, and this effect was strongest at lower latitudes. Superimposed on this trend were peaks in beta diversity at around 400-600 m and also around 1000-1200 m, which may indicate high turnover around the edges of the oxygen minimum zone. Beta diversity was also observed to decrease with latitude, but this effect was only observed in shallower waters (<200 m); latitudinal turnover began to disappear at depths >800 m. At shallower depths (<200 m), peaks in latitudinal turnover were observed at ∼43°N, 39°N, 35°N and 31°N, which corresponded well with several classically observed oceanographic boundaries. Turnover with depth was stronger than latitudinal turnover, and is likely to reflect strong environmental filtering over relatively short distances. Patterns in beta diversity, including latitude-by-depth interactions, should be integrated with other biodiversity measures in ecosystem-based management and conservation of groundfish communities.},

abstract = {Two new high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) analysis products have been developed using optimum interpolation (OI). The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25 degrees and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1 degrees OI analyses.The AVHRR-only product uses Pathfinder AVHRR data (currently available from January 1985 to December 2005) and operational AVHRR data for 2006 onward. Pathfinder AVHRR was chosen over operational AVHRR, when available, because Pathfinder agrees better with the in situ data. The AMSR AVHRR product begins with the start of AMSR data in June 2002. In this product, the primary AVHRR contribution is in regions near land where AMSR is not available. However, in cloud-free regions, use of both infrared and microwave instruments can reduce systematic biases because their error characteristics are independent.},

abstract = {Although previous studies have demonstrated that heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) can be induced by environmental stress, little is known about natural variation in this response over short time scales. We examined how Hsp70 levels varied over days to weeks in two intertidal snail species of the genus Tegula: Sampling was conducted both under naturally changing environmental conditions and in different vertical zones on a rocky shore. The subtidal to low-intertidal T. brunnea was transplanted into shaded and unshaded mid-intertidal cages to assess temporal variation in Hsps under conditions of increased stress. For comparison, the low to mid-intertidal T. funebralis was transplanted into mid-intertidal cages, within this species' natural zone of occurrence. Snails were sampled every 3 to 4 days for one month, and endogenous levels of two Hsp70-kDa family members (Hsp72 and Hsp74) were quantified using solid-phase immunochemistry. Following periods of midday low tides, levels of Hsps increased greatly in transplanted T. brunnea but not in T. funebralis. Levels of Hsps increased less in T. brunnea transplanted to shaded cages than to unshaded cages, suggesting that prolonged emersion and reduction in feeding time per se are factors that are only mildly stressful. Upregulated levels of Hsps returned to base levels within days. In unmanipulated snails collected from their natural zones, Hsp levels showed little change with thermal variation, indicating that these species did not experience thermally stressful conditions during this study. However, under common conditions in the mid-intertidal zone, Hsp70 levels reflected the different thermal sensitivities of the physiological systems of these two species.},

@article{Konar2008,
abstract = {Two distinct organizational states of kelp forest communities, foliose algal assemblages and deforested barren areas, typically display sharp discontinuities. Mechanisms responsible for maintaining these state differences were studied by manipulating various features of their boundary regions. Urchins in the barren areas had significantly smaller gonads than those in adjacent kelp stands, implying that food was a limiting resource for urchins in the barrens. The abundance of drift algae and living foliose algae varied abruptly across the boundary between kelp beds and barren areas. These observations raise the question of why urchins from barrens do not invade kelp stands to improve their fitness. By manipulating kelp and urchin densities at boundary regions and within kelp beds, we tested the hypothesis that kelp stands inhibit invasion of urchins. Urchins that were experimentally added to kelp beds persisted and reduced kelp abundance until winter storms either swept the urchins away or caused them to s...},

Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and detail-independent mechanism may be in action. We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggest that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follows a simple universal mechanism.},

abstract = {Continental South Africa has a coastline of some 3,650 km and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of just over 1 million km(2). Waters in the EEZ extend to a depth of 5,700 m, with more than 65{\%} deeper than 2,000 m. Despite its status as a developing nation, South Africa has a relatively strong history of marine taxonomic research and maintains comprehensive and well-curated museum collections totaling over 291,000 records. Over 3 million locality records from more than 23,000 species have been lodged in the regional AfrOBIS (African Ocean Biogeographic Information System) data center (which stores data from a wider African region). A large number of regional guides to the marine fauna and flora are also available and are listed. The currently recorded marine biota of South Africa numbers at least 12,914 species, although many taxa, particularly those of small body size, remain poorly documented. The coastal zone is relatively well sampled with some 2,500 samples of benthic invertebrate communities have been taken by grab, dredge, or trawl. Almost none of these samples, however, were collected after 1980, and over 99{\%} of existing samples are from depths shallower than 1,000 m--indeed 83{\%} are from less than 100 m. The abyssal zone thus remains almost completely unexplored. South Africa has a fairly large industrial fishing industry, of which the largest fisheries are the pelagic (pilchard and anchovy) and demersal (hake) sectors, both focused on the west and south coasts. The east coast has fewer, smaller commercial fisheries, but a high coastal population density, resulting in intense exploitation of inshore resources by recreational and subsistence fishers, and this has resulted in the overexploitation of many coastal fish and invertebrate stocks. South Africa has a small aquaculture industry rearing mussels, oysters, prawns, and abalone-the latter two in land-based facilities. Compared with many other developing countries, South Africa has a well-conserved coastline, 23{\%} of which is under formal protection, however deeper waters are almost entirely excluded from conservation areas. Marine pollution is confined mainly to the densely populated KwaZulu-Natal coast and the urban centers of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. Over 120 introduced or cryptogenic marine species have been recorded, but most of these are confined to the few harbors and sheltered sites along the coast.},

@article{Baselga2010,
abstract = {Aim Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues.},

@article{Duncan2006a,
abstract = {With probably fewer than 3000 individuals alive in the biodiversity hotspot of the Succulent Karoo in southern Africa, populations of the endemic, Giant Quiver Tree, Aloe pillansii, are thought to be declining and thus threatened with extinction. Using repeat photography and field data we investigated the long-term changes in one population of A. pillansii at its type locality, the roughly 100 ha Cornell's Kop in the Richtersveld, South Africa. There are currently 75 individuals alive at this site. Of these, 44{\%} are {\&}amp;lt 1 m in height (seedlings), 4{\%} are 1-3 m (juveniles) and 52{\%} are {\&}amp;gt 3 m (adults). An analysis of 14 repeat photographs shows that since 1937 an average of 1.4{\%} of the plants {\&}amp;gt 3 m in height has died annually. At this rate all the remaining 39 plants on Cornell's Kop in this size class will be dead in 71 years. The relative paucity of plants in the 1-3 m size classes could be explained by several factors including plant theft, animal damage and unfavourable recruitment conditions during the first 80 years of the 20th century. Annual growth rates decrease as plants age. Individuals {\&}amp;lt 1 m in height grow at 42.5 mm yr⁻ⁱ while plants 1-3 m and those {\&}amp;gt 3 m grow at 31.0 and 16.4 mm yr⁻ⁱ respectively. At 8 m, the tallest plant on Cornell's Kop could be as old as 382 years and thus to maintain itself at this site, A. pillansii would only need to recruit relatively infrequently. The relatively high proportion of seedlings suggests that conditions have recently been favourable for recruitment at this site. Seedling ages, estimated from their heights, indicate that over 50{\%} of the plants {\&}amp;lt 1 m in height germinated 5-10 years ago. This is consistent with local rainfall records which show that rainfall was consistently above the long-term annual average of 75 mm during this period. However, the loss of six seedlings from the population in the last 5 years, probably due to grazing or theft, suggests that without intervention this species will not survive on Cornell's Kop.},

abstract = {The impact of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on the distributions of plant species in the Greater Cape Floristic Region is largely unknown. We used a molecular fingerprinting tool, inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) PCR to examine the spatial distribution of genetic variation in the common and widespread shrub Elytropappus rhinocerotis. We wished to test the hypothesis that refugia for the species were located in areas which were buffered from marked variations in precipitation between glacial and interglacial periods. Populations from less protected areas, in contrast, should have suffered size reductions or extinctions during the dry Holocene optimum. We detected a large amount of genetic variation in the species, which was apportioned largely amongst individuals within populations rather than amongst populations or regions, as expected for an outcrossing and well-dispersed plant species. However, there was significant spatial structure and an uneven distribution of diversity across the range. Geographic distance is a very poor predictor of genetic distance between localities, especially towards the east of the range. This may be due to range alteration over the time-scale reflected by ISSR polymorphism. Inter-SSR variation declined from south to north in the western arm of the range, consistent with the prediction of Holocene aridification starting first and being most extreme in the north. Areas shown by the marker to harbour populations with high levels of variability include most parts of the eastern arm of the range, and the Kamiesberg highlands. Possible explanations for the observed patterns of ISSR variation are discussed.},

@article{Littler1980,
abstract = {A synthetic "functional form" paradigm concerning hypothetically important adaptive features of algal structure and function was developed and tested by a costs/benefits strategic approach. Successional manipulations were performed by disturbing mature, environmentally constant intertidal communities; from the array of colonizing macroalgae, Ulva sp. was chosen as an opportunistic representative of pioneer seral stages, Egregia menziesii and Gelidium purpurascens/robustum as intermediate to late seral species, and Pelvetia fastigiata and Corallina officinalis as characteristic of more mature climax communities. The ranking from high to low primary producers (Ulva {\&}gt; Gelidium {\&}gt; Egregia {\&}gt; Pelvetia {\&}gt; Corallina) indicates that selection in fluctuating environments has favored opportunistic species having high net productivity, while those species able to persist in benign predictable habitats do so at the cost of lower photosynthetic rates and presumably slower growth. The kilocalories per ash-free gram dry weight from highest to lowest species were Ulva (5.44), Gelidium (4.62), Pelvetia (4.17), Egregia (4.10), and Corallina (3.86). With the exception of Pelvetia, which occurs high in the intertidal, these calorific values suggest that selection has tended to reduce nutritive content in climax algal forms. The results for percent thallus loss to urchin grazing over a 48 h period generally support the hypothesis that selection has differentially favored the evolution of antipredator defenses in environmentally constant macrophyte communities; Ulva lost considerably more of its blotted wet weight (43.1{\%}) compared to Pelvetia (36.2{\%}), Gelidium (22.9{\%}), Egregia (22.6{\%}), and the late seral form Corallina (19.6{\%}). Ulva contained the lowest percentage of nonpigmented (structural) components (0.6{\%}), followed by Gelidium (46.2{\%}), Pelvetia (57.3{\%}), Corallina (81.7{\%} CaCO3), and Egregia 82.9{\%}) which indicates that selection in mature communities has tended to increase allocation of materials to nonpigmented supportive structure at the expense of photosynthetic tissue. Later successional macroalgae showed greater toughness as well as greater resistance to wave-shearing forces than the opportunistic species, thus implicating selection for persistence as opposed to rapid growth in climax communities. Data on succession, productivity, and toughness indicate that E. menziesii shifts from an opportunistic strategy during its juvenile stages to a highly differentiated complex form able to persist in mature successional stages. The co-occurrence of different morphological phases of the same species (e.g., Scytosiphon lomentaria, hollow sheet; Petalonia fascia, sheet; and their Ralfsia-like forms, crusts), along with information contrasting productivity, palatability, and longevity between Gigartina papillata and its crustose alternate Petrocelis middendorffii, suggests that some algae have the capacity to concurrently adopt strategies of both opportunistic and climax algal forms.},

A large majority of the shrubs persisted between censuses. Modest birth (establishment) and death rates indicate that plants are replaced approximately every century, while the median longevity of several species is much longer. A 15-yr intercensus interval, appropriate for most species (i.e. birth and death rates were measurable), is too short for several larger shrubs (including Larrea divaricata, Ephedra nevadensis, Yucca schidigera and the larger Opuntia spp.) in which virtually no births or deaths occurred and in which longevity must be extremely high. While individuals of most species grew over the 15-yr interval, others did not, and some individuals shrank in size. In a number of species, individual growth rates were significantly reduced according to the number of neighbouring plants rooted 0.5 - 2.0 m distant. Even Larrea tridentata, one of the largest species, showed significant effects of growth rate reduction where crowded by allospecific plants, despite the generally much smaller sizes of these neighbours.},

abstract = {Quartz fields are edaphically arid, azonal habitats occurring under different macroclimatic conditions in several arid regions of southern Africa. They are the exclusive home of 142 plant species of which ca. 70{\%} are local or regional endemics. This paper is an analysis of the quartz-field floras and growth form-soil relationships in two quartz field regions: the Knersvlakte in the Namaqualand-Namib Domain of the Succulent Karoo, and the western Little Karoo in the Southern Karoo Domain. The Knersvlakte supported 52 quartz-field specialists of which 39 were endemic to the region. Corresponding data for the Little Karoo were 11, and 10 species, respectively. In both regions, the average canopy cover on the quartz-field relev{\'{e}}s was ca. 8{\%}, and more than half of this comprised contracted, succulent nanochamaephytes. Cover and vegetation stature were markedly higher on adjacent zonal habitats. Quartz fields in both regions supported a similar array of compact, subglobose and subterranean nanochamaephytes, as evidenced by convergent patterns in two distantly related genera (Argyroderma N. E. Brown and Gibbaeum (Haworth) N. E. Brown, both Mesembryanthemaceae), endemic to the Knersvlakte and largely restricted to the Little Karoo, respectively. Analyses of vegetational and edaphic data of quartz fields and adjacent, zonal habitats were carried out using multivariate direct gradient analysis (Canonical Correspondence Analysis) in order to identify those factors that control the peculiar composition of growth forms on quartz fields. The results revealed highly similar patterns of growth form composition in relation to similar edaphic gradients in both regions. In general, the soils of quartz fields were shallower compared to those of adjacent zonal habitats. In both regions, two different groups of quartz-field edaphic habitats, representing extremes of a continuum, were identified. Group 1 was characterized by high salt content, neutral to slightly acid soil pH, and low stone content. Group 2 was characterized by low salt content, low soil pH, and high stone content. Group 1 quartz fields are the most edaphically arid habitats and support the highest relative cover and diversity of subglobose and subterranean chamaephytes. The combination of reduced competition from larger growth forms, shallow soils and high soil salinity, represents a regionally unusual selective regime. Some succulent lineages in the Mesembryanthemaceae have undergone diversification which has resulted in the fine-scale discrimination of subtle edaphic gradients within the saline quartz-patch habitats. Reliable seasonal rainfall and reduced thermal stress have also played a role in the evolution of quartz patch specialists., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

abstract = {The thermal response of gas exchange varies among plant species and with growth conditions. Plants from hot dry climates generally reach maximal photosynthetic rates at higher temperatures than species from temperate climates. Likewise, species in these environments are predicted to have small leaves with more-dissected shapes. We compared eight species of Pelargonium (Geraniaceae) selected as phylogenetically independent contrasts on leaf shape to determine whether: (1) the species showed plasticity in thermal response of gas exchange when grown under different water and temperature regimes, (2) there were differences among more-and less-dissected leafed species in trait means or plasticity, and (3) whether climatic variables were correlated with the responses. We found that a higher growth temperature led to higher optimal photosynthetic temperatures, at a cost to photosynthetic capacity. Optimal temperatures for photosynthesis were greater than the highest growth temperature regime. Stomatal conductance responded to growth water regime but not growth temperature, whereas transpiration increased and water use efficiency (WUE) decreased at the higher growth temperature. Strikingly, species with more-dissected leaves had higher rates of carbon gain and water loss for a given growth condition than those with less-dissected leaves. Species from lower latitudes and lower rainfall tended to have higher photosynthetic maxima and conductance, but leaf dissection did not correlate with climatic variables. Our results suggest that the combination of dissected leaves, higher photosynthetic rates, and relatively low WUE may have evolved as a strategy to optimize water delivery and carbon gain during short-lived periods of high soil moisture. Higher thermal optima, in conjunction with leaf dissection, may reflect selection pressure to protect photosynthetic machinery against excessive leaf temperatures when stomata close in response to water stress.},

The fundamental parameters of range, probability of occurrence and temperature modification caused by water from deeper sea layers raised by an upwelling event and spreading across the surface were established for three regions (Hel, Leba and Kolobrzeg). The Kolobrzeg upwelling region had the largest spatial range (up to 5000 km(2)). The region with the smallest spatial range (Hel, up to 1400 km(2)) had the largest surface temperature amplitude (to 14 degrees C), the largest maximum temperature gradient (5 degrees C km(-1)) and the largest average sea surface temperature decrease in the centre in relation to the background value.},

@article{Hendricks2005,
abstract = {The study described changes in floristic and vegetation structure in relation to livestock grazing intensity in a conservation area in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa. Grazing by goats and sheep is allowed in the Richtersveld National Park (a contractual National Park) which is also an area of high floristic richness and endemism. We used goat faecal pellet density, degree of trampling and percentage bare-ground at distances from the stock posts as surrogates for a gradient in grazing pressure. A stock post is the place where farmers keep, in most cases in an enclosure called a 'kraal', their animals at night and to which they return every evening after the day's herding. Twenty-seven stock posts were located in the Richtersveld National Park; nine stock posts on flats, footslopes and mountain each. We measured plant species richness and diversity, and mean percentage cover of the various plant growth forms (including the number of species falling into each growth form category) in each of the five 10 m × 10 m plots (each 200 m apart) demarcated along a transect of one kilometre length from the centre of each stock post. The results showed that distance from the stock post does reflect grazing intensity use because densities in faecal pellets rapidly declined with increasing distances away from the stock post for all habitats studied. Faecal density was positively correlated with stocking density. Plant species richness and diversity was at a minimum near stock posts. Plants able to endure the effects of heavy grazing occurred near stock posts where declines in palatable plant species, assumingly sensitive to heavy grazing and trampling, were recorded. Grazing increased vegetation patchiness up to 800 m from the stock post for all the habitats. The degree to which this change in species composition occurred did not depend on stocking densities, suggesting that both grazing and landscape variability were responsible for vegetation changes in rangelands of that area of the Succulent Karoo biome.},

@article{Hofmann2011,
abstract = {Photosynthetic assimilation of carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients by phytoplankton constitutes a necessary prerequisite for sustaining marine life. This process is tightly linked to the concentration of chlorophyll in the ocean's euphotic zone. According to a recent field study marine chlorophyll(a) concentrations have declined over the last century with an estimated global rate of 1.0{\%} of the global median per year. Here we attempt to identify possible mechanisms which could explain such trends. We explore these questions using an ocean general circulation model forced with documented historic and projected future anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide according to the IPCC SRES A1FI emission scenario until the year 2100. We further extend the time period covered by the A1FI scenario by assuming a linear decline in emissions from 2100 to 2200 and keeping them at zero levels until 2400. Our numerical simulations reveal only weak reductions in chlorophyll(a) concentrations during the twentieth century, but project a 50{\%} decline between 2000 and 2200. We identify a local and a remotely acting mechanism for this reduction in the North Atlantic: (I) increased sea surface temperatures reduce local deep mixing and, hence, reduce the nutrient supply from waters at intermediate depths; (II) a steady shoaling of the Atlantic overturning cell tends to transport increasingly nutrient depleted waters from the Southern Hemisphere toward the north, leading to further diminishment of nutrient supply. These results provide support for a temperature-driven decline in ocean chlorophyll(a) and productivity, but suggest that additional mechanisms need to be invoked to explain observed declines in recent decades.},

@article{Meynard2007,
abstract = {Aim To test statistical models used to predict species distributions under different shapes of occurrence–environment relationship. We addressed three questions: (1) Is there a statistical technique that has a consistently higher predictive ability than others for all kinds of relationships? (2) How does species prevalence influence the relative performance of models? (3) When an automated stepwise selection procedure is used, does it improve predictive modelling, and are the relevant variables being selected? Location We used environmental data from a real landscape, the state of California, and simulated species distributions within this landscape. Methods Eighteen artificial species were generated, which varied in their occurrence response to the environmental gradients considered (random, linear, Gaussian, threshold or mixed), in the interaction of those factors (no interaction vs. multiplicative), and on their prevalence (50{\%} vs. 5{\%}). The landscape was then randomly sampled with a large ( n = 2000) or small ( n = 150) sample size, and the predictive ability of each statistical approach was assessed by comparing the true and predicted distributions using five different indexes of performance (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve, Kappa, correlation between true and predictive probability of occurrence, sensitivity and specificity). We compared generalized additive models (GAM) with and without flexible degrees of freedom, logistic regressions (general linear models, GLM) with and without variable selection, classification trees, and the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP). Results Species with threshold and mixed responses, additive environmental effects, and high prevalence generated better predictions than did other species for all statistical models. In general, GAM outperforms all other strategies, although differences with GLM are usually not significant. The two variable-selection strategies presented here did not discriminate successfully between truly causal factors and correlated environmental variables. Main conclusions Based on our analyses, we recommend the use of GAM or GLM over classification trees or GARP, and the specification of any suspected interaction terms between predictors. An expert-based variable selection procedure was preferable to the automated procedures used here. Finally, for low-prevalence species, variability in model performance is both very high and sample-dependent. This suggests that distribution models for species with low prevalence can be improved through targeted sampling. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We used nitrogen isotope analysis from pectoral muscle of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) to determine intrapopulation variation in sources of dietary protein throughout the year in northern Israel. In Mediterranean climates, winter and summer are stable seasons, whereas spring and fall are transitional seasons. Number of species of fruit-bearing plants is higher during the transitional periods, and we therefore predicted that intrapopulation variation would be higher during spring than in winter and summer; we made no prediction for fall because sample size was small. We also reconstructed sources of dietary protein for each individual using nitrogen isotope ratios ($\delta$¹⁵N) to determine whether individuals foraged on the same sources of food within each season. Intrapopulation variation in $\delta$¹⁵N was significantly higher in spring ($\delta$¹⁵N range: 9.7-17.5‰) compared to winter (8.8-11.1‰) and summer (9.5-11.2‰), suggesting that individuals during this period varied more in their use of protein sources. Dietary reconstruction revealed intrapopulation partitioning among the bats in the use of plant food items, and interspecific partitioning among plants in their dependence on dispersal by bats.},

@article{Zapala2006,
abstract = {A fundamental step in the analysis of gene expression and other high-dimensional genomic data is the calculation of the similarity or distance between pairs of individual samples in a study. If one has collected N total samples and assayed the expression level of G genes on those samples, then an N x N similarity matrix can be formed that reflects the correlation or similarity of the samples with respect to the expression values over the G genes. This matrix can then be examined for patterns via standard data reduction and cluster analysis techniques. We consider an alternative to conventional data reduction and cluster analyses of similarity matrices that is rooted in traditional linear models. This analysis method allows predictor variables collected on the samples to be related to variation in the pairwise similarity/distance values reflected in the matrix. The proposed multivariate method avoids the need for reducing the dimensions of a similarity matrix, can be used to assess relationships between the genes used to construct the matrix and additional information collected on the samples under study, and can be used to analyze individual genes or groups of genes identified in different ways. The technique can be used with any high-dimensional assay or data type and is ideally suited for testing subsets of genes defined by their participation in a biochemical pathway or other a priori grouping. We showcase the methodology using three published gene expression data sets.},

abstract = {Organic carbon (C) in lakes originates from two distinct sources-primary production from within the lake itself (autochthonous supply) and importation of organic matter from the terrestrial watershed (allochthonous supply). By manipulating the ¹³C of dissolved inorganic C, thereby labeling within-lake primary production, we examined the relative importance of autochthonous and allochthonous C in supporting bacterial production. For 35 days, NaH¹³CO₃ was added daily to two small, forested lakes. One of the lakes (Peter) was fertilized so that primary production exceeded total respiration in the epilimnion. The other lake (Tuesday), in contrast, was low in productivity and had high levels of colored dissolved organic C (DOC). To obtain bacterial C isotopes, bacteria were regrown in situ in particle-free lake water in dialysis tubes. The contribution of allochthonous C to bacterial biomass was calculated by applying a two-member mixing model. In the absence of a direct measurement, the isotopic signature of the autochthonous end-member was estimated indirectly by three different approaches. Although there was excess primary production in Peter Lake, bacterial biomass consisted of 43-46{\%} allochthonous C. In Tuesday Lake more than 75{\%} of bacterial growth was supported by allochthonous C. Although bacteria used autochthonous C preferentially over allochthonous C, DOC from the watershed contributed significantly to bacterial production. In combination with results from similar experiments in different lakes, our findings suggest that the contribution of allochthonous C to bacterial production can be predicted from ratios of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a surrogate for allochthonous supply) and chlorophyll a (a surrogate for autochthonous supply).},

abstract = {Abstract The new NOAA operational global sea surface temperature (SST) analysis is described. The analyses use 7 days of in situ (ship and buoy) and satellite SST. These analyses are produced weekly and daily using optimum interpolation (OI) on a 1° grid. The OI technique requires the specification of data and analysis error statistics. These statistics are derived and show that the SST rms data errors from ships are almost twice as large as the data errors from buoys or satellites. In addition, the average e-folding spatial error scales have been found to be 850 km in the zonal direction and 615 km in the meridional direction. The analysis also includes a preliminary step that corrects any satellite biases relative to the in situ data using Poisson's equation. The importance of this correction is demonstrated using recent data following the 1991 eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo. The OI analysis has been computed using the in situ and bias-corrected satellite data for the period 1985 to present.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes particularly of carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, and hydrogen, can be very useful for tracing and quantifying the amounts of anthropogenic and natural terrigenous organic matter in the marine environment. In many circumstances, they provide the only way of deter mining the origins of this material. However, the method has definite limitations which must be taken into account. In particular, one must always measure the possible sources of the organic matter in individual locations.Results indicate that there is little transport of terrestrially-derived organics more than a few kilometers from shore. The terrestrial material which is present in offshore sediments appears to be relatively refractory to biological assimilation. Studies of anthropogenic organic matter confirm that such pollution is primarily confined to local areas.Different sorts of information can be obtained from isotope ratios depending on the type of sample examined. Ratios of particulate organic matter (POC) reflect not only conservative transport of material but also in situ biological processes altering organic matter. Sediments provide information on the integrated result of organic matter deposition throughout the year. The ratios in organisms result from the organic matter present in the environment as well as its bioavailability. Dissolved organic matter can also be measured and its ratio does differ depending on the relative amounts of terrestrial- to marine-derived constituents. However, little work has been yet done in this area. Individual chemical compounds or classes of compounds can also be examined isotopically, providing information on particular chemicals rather than organic matter as a whole.Stable isotope ratios should be used in conjunction with physical and biological information as well as C/N ratios, lignin oxidation products.},

abstract = {A database of monthly average sea surface temperature (SST) from 1984-2003 has been developed from U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) records, corresponding to geographic coordinates for 5 1 reef tracts throughout the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. These data represent part of a collective SST record for 206 globally-distributed coral reef sites in the Global Coral Reef Alliance (GCRA) Coral Reef SST Database (www.globalcoral.org). The temperature series covers two full decades of active climate change and marine ecosystem responses, during which mass coral reef bleaching, emerging diseases, biodiversity losses, species mortalities, fisheries declines, and reef frame degradation have been reported. Reef ecosystem changes appear when the monthly SST anomaly exceeds 1.0 degrees C above warm season averages, defined as a HotSpot. If the anomaly reaches 2 degrees C or more and/or if the duration of the anomaly is prolonged at the same site, the ecological responses are more severe. Linear trend lines and regression coefficients for the SST at each site document both the degree and rate of temperature change, allowing comparisons to be made among sites. Impacts from coastal upwelling that circulates deep, cool and nutrient-rich water to the surface and alters the productivity of reef fisheries are embedded within the SST record. Maximum and minimum temperature exposures, yearly variations in SST, and seasonal fluctuations may be analyzed from the database. These calibrated and comparative data serve to describe how SST trends at a site contrast or conform to neighboring upstream or downstream sites. Site-specific thermal records offer a basis for developing individualized management strategies and for formulating unique conservation policies for regional reefs. The differences among temperature trends in the database may account for the degradation of some reefs and the relative sparing of others. From this historical record of thermal conditions on coral reefs, we may generate early alerts about potential marine ecosystem responses from persistent climate change. Rev. Biol.

HL plants had larger leaves with higher specific weight, water content and diurnal malic acid fluctuation.

Comparison of the PPFD responses of linear electron flow rates derived from gas exchange measurements and from fluorescence analysis ({\$}\backslashmathscr{\{}F{\}}{\$}F) indicated effective photosynthetic control, {\$}\backslashmathscr{\{}F{\}}{\$}F was always larger than electron flow rates calculated from gas exchange, indicating that processes other than carboxylation and oxygenation were consistently important in energy consumption under all sampled environmental conditions. Regardless of PPFD during growth, electron flow to carboxylation and {\$}\backslashmathscra{\{}F{\}}{\$}F were linearly correlated, demonstrating that the photosynthetic apparatus was well adapted to PPFD during growth. In HL plants, non-photochemical quenching increased, and photochemical quenching and the quantum yield of linear electron transport through PS II decreased more slowly with increasing PPFD than in LL plants. In plants of both treatments non-photochemical energy dissipation seemed to be exhausted when the proportion of photons not utilizable by photochemistry exceeded 0.7. Results illustrate a pronounced ability of D. tradescantioides to acclimate to a 100 {\%} change in the prevailing PPFD and lend support to the hypothesis that CAM cycling might act as a photoprotective process.},

abstract = {An improvement to the Network Analysis Method (NAM) in Biogeography based on weighted inference and dynamic exploration of sympatry networks is proposed. Intricate distributions of species result in a reticulated structure of spatial associations. Species are geographically connected through sympatry links forming an overall natural network in biogeography. Spatial records are the signals that provide evidence to infer these sympatry links in the network. Punctual data are independent of a priori area determination. NAM is oriented to detect groups of species embedded into the global network that are internally sustained by sympatric cohesiveness but weakly connected (or disconnected) to outgroup entities. These groups, called units of co-occurrence (UCs), are segregated through the iterative removal of intermediary species according to their betweenness scores. Instances of analysis of the original NAM are improved through the following changes and extensions: (i) inference of weighted sympatry networks using new measures sensitive to the strength of overlap and topological resemblance between set of points; (ii) construction of a basal network discriminating major from minor sympatry associations; (iii) evaluation of the entire process of iterative removal of intermediary species for the selection of UCs found on different subnetworks; (iv) network partitioning based on the intrinsic cohesiveness of the UCs; (v) production of a graphical tool (cleavogram) depicting the structural changes of the network along the removal process. Improvements are tested using real and hypothetical data sets. Resolution of patterns is notably increased due to a more accurate recognition of allopatric patterns and the possibility of segregating spatially overlapped UCs. As in original NAM, spatial expressions of UCs are building blocks for biogeography supported by strictly endemic and connected species through sympatry paths.},

Here we examine the biogeographic structure of recruitment variability along the U. S. West Coast and examine its association with temperature variability. From 1997 to 2004 we monitored monthly recruitment rates of dominant intertidal invertebrates, mussels and barnacles, at 26 rocky shore sites on the West Coast of the United States, from northern Oregon to southern California, a span of 1750 km of coastline. We examined spatial variation in the dynamics of recruitment rates and their relationship to coastal oceanography using satellite- derived time series of monthly sea surface temperature ( SST). Recruitment rates showed a biogeographic structure with large regions under similar dynamics delimited by abrupt transitions. The seasonal peak in recruitment rates for both mussels and barnacles changed from a late summer - early fall peak in Oregon to winter or early spring in northern California, and then back toward summer in southern California. Recruitment rates varied greatly in magnitude across the latitudinal range. The barnacle Balanus glandula and mussels ( Mytilus spp.) showed a decline of two orders of magnitude south of Oregon. In contrast, recruitment rates of barnacles of the genus Chthamalus showed a variable pattern across the region examined. The spatial distribution of associations between raw SST and recruitment rates for all species showed positive associations, indicating recruitment during warm months, for all species in Oregon, northern California, and several sites in south- central California. By considerably extending the spatial and temporal scales beyond that of previous studies on larval recruitment rates in this system, our study has identi. ed major biogeographic breaks around Cape Blanco and Point Conception despite considerable spatial and temporal variation within each region and among species. These large differences in recruitment rates across biogeographic scales highlight the need for a better understanding of larval responses to ocean circulation patterns in the conservation and management of coastal ecosystems.},

This can be felt when moving forward into the sea ('vertically homogeneous' and 'horizontally different'), but also when standing still between one's feet and body ('vertically different'). On a calm summer-day, an array of high-precision sensors has measured fast temperature-changes up to 1 °C near a Texel-island (NL) beach. The measurements show that sensed variations are in fact internal waves, fronts and turbulence, supported in part by vertical stable stratification in density (temperature). Such motions are common in the deep ocean, but generally not in shallow seas where turbulent mixing is expected strong enough to homogenize. The internal beach-waves have amplitudes ten-times larger than those of the small surface wind waves. Quantifying their turbulent mixing gives diffusivity estimates of 10(-4)-10(-3) m(2) s(-1), which are larger than found in open-ocean but smaller than wave breaking above deep sloping topography.},

@article{Burke2005,
abstract = {This study investigated endemic plants in the Sperrgebiet in the succulent karoo - a global biodiversity hotspot in southern Africa. In order to develop hypotheses regarding the evolution of this endemic flora, the following questions were posed: 1) Are taxonomic patterns similar at different levels of taxonomic order? 2) Are adaptations of Sperrgebiet endemic taxa different from the overall flora? 3) Are adaptations different in related endemic and non-endemic taxa? There is an over-representation of species of Mesembryanthemaceae in the endemic flora, which is in accordance with patterns in the succulent karoo biome overall. The nearly 37{\%} contribution of Mesembryanthemaceae to the endemic flora is, however, remarkably higher than elsewhere in the biome. The over-representation of this family is not maintained at a higher level of taxonomic order, supporting the notion of recent speciation in this family. Regarding plant functional attributes, major differences between the endemic and non-endemic flora exist. Compact leaf-succulents with canopy stored, water-dispersed seeds, as well as bulbs and shrubby leaf-succulents predominate the endemic flora. Differences in reproductive (seed storage and dispersal distance) and growth form attributes between the endemic and non-endemic flora were largely influenced by phylogenetic history. Minutism (plant height {\&}lt;10 cm) was favoured by many endemic plants, but this was not only influenced by phylogenetic factors. Two hypotheses emerged from these observations: 1) the evolution of minutism is largely driven by external factors in the Sperrgebiet, and 2) external factors and phylogenetic history are likely of equal importance in the development of the Sperrgebiet endemic flora.},

@phdthesis{Hill2008,
abstract = {There are broad differences in regional oceanography and primary production around the South African coast, which we might expect to give rise to major differences in trophic pathways. $\delta$[superscript 13]C and $\delta$[superscript 15]N isotopic ratios of suspended particulate matter (SPM), mussels, various intertidal consumers and common macroalgae along the South African coastline were explored using stable isotope analysis to investigate biogeographic and temporal variability of isotopic signatures of marine intertidal consumers and their food sources around the coast of South Africa, with a focus on evaluating the dependence of intertidal mussels on phytoplankton and macroalgal-derived organic carbon.
Isotopic equilibration rates of four mussel tissues were determined through laboratory feeding experiments, which established that adductor tissue had the slowest isotopic turnover rate, and was subsequently used as an indication of overall mussel diet. Biogeographic, temporal and nearshore/offshore trends of isotopic ratios of SPM were investigated along 10km transects perpendicular to the coast and SPM exhibited overall trends of carbon depletion when moving from west to east along the coastline and from nearshore to offshore water, in both cases suggesting a shift from macrophyte detritus to a phytoplankton signature. $\delta$[superscript 13]C signatures of SPM also revealed temporal and biogeographic variation that had strong ties to local oceanography, being closely correlated to regional hydrographic features and tidal influences. Mixing models indicated filter feeders demonstrated over 50{\%} dependence on nearshore SPM for organic carbon and it was possible to categorize them into geographic groups based on their carbon and nitrogen signatures, suggesting biogeographic shifts in resources. Biogeographic shifts in diet were also seen in some grazers. Difficulties in relating macroalgae to mussel diet led to investigations into the isotopic changes associated with macroalgal decomposition. Variation in photosynthetic fractionation, leaching and microbial mineralization are believed to have resulted from species-specific patterns of degradation. Although the strong links between carbon signatures and local oceanography indicate that stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool for the study of water mixing and coastal hydrography in relation to food-web analyses, substantial variation in fractionation of primary consumers, along with different periods of time integration between consumers and their food sources must be considered in future studies, to resolve trophic links in marine food webs successfully.},

abstract = {A method is described for the direct determination of dissolved phosphate and silicate in seawater using ion exclusion chromatography (IEC) coupled with sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICPMS). Dissolved silicate was determined by double isotope dilution using a (29)Si spike, whereas one point gravimetric standard addition with internal standard of the same (29)Si spike was employed to quantitate dissolved phosphate. Medium resolution was used for all measurements in order to resolve polyatomic interferences on Si and P isotopes. Concentrations of 1.670 ± 0.008 and 30.20 ± 0.09 $\mu$M (SD, n = 6) with precisions of 0.47 and 0.31{\%} for the dissolved phosphate and silicate, respectively, were obtained in National Research Council Canada certified reference material MOOS-3 seawater, in good agreement with certified values of 1.60 ± 0.15 and 30.5 ± 0.8 $\mu$M (U, k = 2), respectively. The reported method is a rapid (10 min per run), simple, and accurate online technique that requires no sample pretreatment. Moreover, this procedure achieves <0.5{\%} precision (at above analyte concentrations) and method detection limits of 0.006 and 0.004 $\mu$M (0.18 as P and 0.11 ng g(-1) as Si), respectively, using a of 100 $\mu$L injection of seawater. The proposed technique is robust and well-suited for the determination of dissolved phosphate and silicate in seawater.},

Data were collected by moored thermistors and during a ship's cruise, and wind measurements were made at Cape Recife and Bird Island. Results confirmed upwelling off the southern shoreline of Cape Recife during easterly or north-easterly winds. When the wind switched to westerly or south-westerly, upwelling relaxed and cold water that had broken the surface during upwelling was dispersed eastwards towards the point of Cape Recife. Within a few hours of the change in wind direction to westerly, cold water was observed along the Algoa Bay shoreline of Cape Recife. The influence of wind-forcing and Kelvin waves on upwelling and the emergence of cold water along the Bay-side shoreline of the cape are discussed.},

Traditional approaches to assessing structural and functional responses of coastal systems include measures of species composition and water quality, but fisheries assessments are often left out because of the perception that fisheries species are too mobile and cannot easily be linked to local conditions. Stable isotopes have emerged as a new and useful way to understand movements and productivity of mobile shrimp and fish species across estuarine seascapes. Two case studies from Louisiana, USA, suggest that estuaries with healthy fishery food webs might be identified using isotope indicators that show low anthropogenic N inputs, strong benthic contributions, and moderate to high fisheries residency and productivity in marsh and mid- salinity areas.},

This paper presents a visual analytics tool, OntoVis, for understanding large, heterogeneous social networks, in which nodes and links could represent different concepts and relations, respectively. These concepts and relations are related through an ontology (also known as a schema). OntoVis is named such because it uses information in the ontology associated with a social network to semantically prune a large, heterogeneous network. In addition to semantic abstraction, OntoVis also allows users to do structural abstraction and importance filtering to make large networks manageable and to facilitate analytic reasoning. All these unique capabilities of OntoVis are illustrated with several case studies.},

@article{Gannon2006,
abstract = {This might seem like an unusual topic, as most scientists seem to know exactly what a PhD is and for what it stands. But on closer inspection, a PhD has as many meanings as there are educational systems. It is not—and has never been—a single, well-defined qualification. As research practices and funding change, the situation becomes even more confused, with consequences for the quality of both scientific training and research.

I received my PhD from a British university. After three years of research, I sub-mitted a three-centimetre-thick thesis that addressed a specific problem. Being awarded my doctorate meant that I knew my topic, I understood enzymology, I could work with proteins and I was able to navigate the complexities of enzyme kinetics. I was not qualified for the title until I was able to demonstrate all these things. In essence, my PhD showed that I developed from a dependent student into an independent scientist.

Since then, PhDs in the UK seem to have changed. More often than not, a PhD is now awarded after the completion of a fixed term of research. Of course, there is an overall topic, but if the student does not reach a hypothesis-based conclusion within a timeframe of about three years, this is no longer a hindrance to earning the degree. Increasingly, the thesis has become a report with an emphasis on training rather than the detailed description of a scientific project.},

@article{Cardoso2009,
abstract = {Aim Researchers measuring beta diversity have rarely concerned themselves with the problems of how complete the species lists of studied communities are, and of how the varying degrees of completeness can actually change estimates of beta diversity. No comprehensive assessment has been made regarding the behaviour of most beta diversity indices when applied to incomplete samples, a situation which is more common than usually recognized. Our objective was to assess the behaviour and robustness of a number of beta diversity measures for incidence data from undersampled communities. Location Mainland Portugal and the Azorean archipelago (North Atlantic). Methods Data from intensive sampling of spiders in mainland Portugal and arthropods in Azores were collected. We examined the properties of 15 beta diversity measures developed for incidence data. We simulated varying degrees of completeness, whereas computing beta diversity for selected pairs of samples. The robustness of these beta diversity accumulation curves was assessed for the purpose of finding the best measures for undersampled communities. Results The Harrison et al $\beta$₋₂ and the Williams $\beta$₋₃ are particularly robust to undersampling. These measures are also insensitive to differences of alpha diversity (species richness) between communities, and therefore to nestedness. Colwell {\&} Coddington {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}{\{}cc{\}} {\$} and the related Jaccard {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}j {\$} and Gaston et al. {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}g {\$} performed best of the measures sensitive to alpha diversity. They performed poorly, however, when compared communities exhibited very low values of beta diversity. In such cases, the Routledge {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}r {\$} performed the best. Main conclusions No index was found to perform without bias in all circumstances. Overall, $\beta$₋₂ , $\beta$₋₃ and {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}{\{}cc{\}} {\$} (or related measures {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}j {\$} and {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}g {\$} ) are recommended as they seem to be the most robust to undersampling.},

abstract = {The combination of a chamber for CO2 gas exchange with a potometric measuring arrangement allowed concomitant investigations into CO2 gas exchange, transpiration and water uptake by the roots of whole plants of Senecio medleywoodii, a species which exhibits Crassulacean acid metabolism. The water-uptake rate showed the same daily pattern as malate concentration and osmotic potential. The accumulation of organic acids resulting from nocturnal CO2 fixation enhanced the water-uptake rate from dusk to dawn. During the day the water-uptake rates decreased with decreasing organic-acid concentration. With gradually increasing water stress, CO2 dark fixation of S. medley-woodii was increased as long as water could be taken up by the roots. It was also shown that a reestablished water supply after drought caused a similar increase which in both cases ameliorated the water uptake in order to conserve a positive water balance for as long as possible. This water-uptake pattern shows that Crassulacean acid metabolism is not only a water-saving adaptation but also enhances water uptake and is directly correlated with the amelioration of the plant water status.},

abstract = {Chokka squid biomass and catch are highly variable, likely owing to their links to changes in the ecosystem, which impact spawning and recruitment. A synthesis of basic ecosystem components for the domain in which chokka squid live (i.e. South Africa's west coast and Agulhas Bank) was prepared using published and new data. It included bottom temperature, bottom dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and copepod abundance. Alongshore gradients of these indicated that the main spawning grounds on the eastern Agulhas Bank are positioned where bottom temperature and bottom dissolved oxygen are optimal for embryonic development. This location, however, appears suboptimal for hatchlings because the copepod maximum (food for paralarvae) is typically on the central Agulhas Bank some 200 km to the west. Data on currents suggest that this constraint may be overcome by the existence of a net west-flowing shelf current on the eastern Agulhas Bank, improving survivorship of paralarvae by transporting them passively towards the copepod maximum. CTD data and a temporal analysis of AVHRR satellite imagery reveal the copepod maximum to be supported by a "cold ridge", a mesoscale upwelling filament present during summer when squid spawning peaks. In situ sea surface temperature (SST) data used as a proxy for cold ridge activity demonstrate considerable interannual variability of the feature, especially during El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation events. Negative linear correlations between maximum summer SST (monthly average) and squid biomass the following autumn (r2 = 0.94), and annual catch (r 2 = 0.69), support the link between the "cold ridge-copepod maximum" and the early life cycle of chokka squid, and holds promise for prediction. ?? 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Only the first 21 vertical levels (from 5.0 m to 729.35 m) were considered here, since the most important changes in heat content observed for the world ocean during the last decades, correspond to the upper 700 m. Warming was observed to be considerably higher at ocean locations than at coastal ones. Ocean warming ranged from values on the order of 0.3 °C dec(-1) near surface to less than 0.1 °C dec(-1) at 500 m, while coastal warming showed values close to 0.2 °C dec(-1) near surface, decreasing rapidly below 0.1 °C dec(-1) for depths on the order of 50 m. The heat content anomaly for the upper 700 m, showed a sharp increase from coast (0.46 Wm(-2)) to ocean (1.59 Wm(-2)). The difference between coastal and ocean values was related to the presence of coastal upwelling, which partially inhibits the warming from surface of near shore water.},

Sclerophyllous species with C₃ photosynthesis were the most effective water savers followed by succulents exhibiting CAM, while C₃ pathway-succulents lose as much water as malacophyllous species. The different species showed either one or two peaked patterns of both transpiration and leaf conductance. With C₃ plants the most common pattern is a single morning peak in leaf conductance followed by decreases in conductance over the remainder of the day. With CAM succulents leaf conductance is high in the morning, shows a pronounced midday depression and increases in the early afternoon when the malate pool is depleted, but malate consumption did not start earlier than 4 h after dawn. Seven of nine investigated C₃ plants had rather high contents of malate, up to 180 {\$}\backslashmu \backslashtext{\{}mol{\}}\backslashcdot \backslashtext{\{}g{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} dry matter. In these plants the malate content increased with increasing leaf conductance and disappeared when leaf conductance declined in the evening, indicating that malate was synthesized during photosynthesis.},

We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.},

@article{Wernberg2013,
abstract = {Explaining spatial patterns of biological organisation remains a central challenge for biogeographic studies. In marine systems, large-scale ocean currents can modify broad-scale biological patterns by simultaneously connecting environmental (e.g. temperature, salinity and nutrients) and biological (e.g. amounts and types of dispersed propagules) properties of adjacent and distant regions. For example, steep environmental gradients and highly variable, disrupted flow should lead to heterogeneity in regional communities and high species turnover. In this study, we investigated the possible imprint of the Leeuwin (LC) and East Australia (EAC) Currents on seaweed communities across {\~{}}7,000 km of coastline in temperate Australia. These currents flow poleward along the west and east coasts of Australia, respectively, but have markedly different characteristics. We tested the hypothesis that, regional seaweed communities show serial change in the direction of current flow and that, because the LC is characterised by a weaker temperature gradient and more un-interrupted along-shore flow compared to the EAC, then coasts influenced by the LC have less variable seaweed communities and lower species turnover across regions than the EAC. This hypothesis was supported. We suggest that this pattern is likely caused by a combination of seaweed temperature tolerances and current-driven dispersal. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that the characteristics of continental-scale currents can influence regional community organisation, and that the coupling of ocean currents and marine biological structure is a general feature that transcends taxa and spatial scales.},

abstract = {Two CAM plant species (Kalanchoe daigremontiana and K. tubiflora) were cultivated in pure cultures with two different levels of nitrogen and water supply. A comparison of the plant dry weight showed that the productivity was severely reduced under low nitrogen or/and water conditions. Additionally the proportion of the different organs contributing to the total biomass, and thus the ratio of root/shoot dry weight shifted substantially. At the same time the production of leaf buds in ratio to leaf biomass was increased. Concentrations of organic nitrogen and nitrate in the shoots were drastically reduced under low nitrogen or/and water conditions, but organic nitrogen concentration in the roots remained relatively high. The leaf conductance over a day was investigated only for K. daigremontiana, and decreased with reduced water and nitrogen supply. The results indicate that CAM plants do not have the predicted high nitrogen use efficiency. Under environmental stress they change from biomass production towards provisions for life preservation.},

abstract = {Explaining the mechanisms that produce the enormous diversity within and between tropical tree communities is a pressing challenge for plant community ecologists. Mechanistic hypotheses range from niche-based deterministic to dispersal-based stochastic models. Strong tests of these hypotheses require detailed information regarding the functional strategies of species. A few tropical studies to date have examined trait dispersion within individual forest plots using species trait means in order to ask whether coexisting species tend to be more or less functionally similar than expected given a null model. The present work takes an alternative approach by: (i) explicitly incorporating population-level trait variability; and (ii) quantifying the functional beta diversity in a series of 15 tropical forest plots arrayed along an elevational gradient. The results show a strong pattern of decay in community functional similarity with elevation.

@article{Brown2014,
abstract = {As climate change rapidly alters the world's oceans, marine life will have to acclimate and/or adapt to warmer and more acidic conditions. While there is a growing body of literature on the individual effects of elevated temperature and CO₂ on marine biota, few studies have examined the synergistic effects of these factors, especially regarding how they impact species interactions. In coastal environments of temperate latitudes, forests of kelp (large brown seaweeds in the Order Laminariales) provide habitat and food for numerous species, support enhanced biodiversity, and provide important ecosystem services. Consequently, impacts to these important ecosystem engineers can have disproportionately large effects on coastal ecosystem functioning. To determine how climate change might impact kelp forest ecosystems, I examined two of the more conspicuous and ecologically important kelp forest species, namely the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. First, I performed three separate experiments in order to determine the effects of elevated temperature and pCO₂ on M. pyrifera growth and photosynthetic performance. In my first experiment I cultured M. pyrifera meristematic tissues under three pCO₂ levels (500, 1000, 1500 matm CO₂) and examined how this impacted their growth, steady-state photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and changes in their tissue carbon:nitrogen ratios. In my second experiment, I used a fully factorial design with two temperatures (12°C and 15°C) and two pCO₂ levels (500 matm and 1500 matm CO₂), and examined how these impacted kelp growth, steady-state photosynthetic carbon uptake, and tissue carbon:nitrogen ratios. In my third experiment, I used the same fully factorial design (12°C and 15°C; 500 matm and 1500 matm CO₂), but examined changes in kelp photosynthetic pigment composition and carbonic anhydrase activity (an estimate of their ability to use HCO3 - in photosynthesis). Counter to my expectations, elevating only pCO₂ in the water had no effect on kelp growth rates, photosynthesis or tissue carbon:nitrogen ratios in either of the first two experiments. In contrast, in the second experiment, elevating only seawater temperature resulted in a significant reduction in both photosynthesis and growth, and an increase in tissue carbon:nitrogen ratios. However, when seawater temperature and pCO₂ were increased together, the kelps exhibited significant increases in photosynthesis and growth relative to the other treatments This suggested that rising ocean temperatures may interact with rising pCO₂ to elicit responses that are different than when either of these factors is increased by itself. In my third experiment, elevating pCO₂ in the water significantly reduced carbonic anhydrase activity, suggesting a reduction in HCO₃ --based photosynthesis (i.e. a down regulation of carbon concentrating mechanisms) and an increase in CO₂-based photosynthesis. In contrast, elevating temperature and/or CO₂ alone had littleto- no impact on photosynthetic pigment concentrations. Following the experiments on M. pyrifera, I then examined how climate change will impact the interactions between S. purpuratus and M. pyrifera. Here, I cultured these two species separately under both "present day" conditions (i.e. 12°C and 500 matm CO₂) and "future" conditions (i.e. 15°C and 1500 matm CO₂) for three months. During this period, urchins were fed kelp from either their own water conditions or the alternate conditions, resulting in a fully factorial design with four treatment combinations (urchins held under either present day or future conditions being fed kelps grown under either present day or future conditions). My results indicate that urchins held under future conditions exhibited reduced feeding and growth rates, and smaller gonads than urchins held under present day conditions regardless of the conditions in which their food was grown. In contrast, urchins held under present day conditions and fed kelp grown under future conditions showed higher feeding and growth rates compared to similar urchins fed kelps grown under present day conditions. Together, my data suggest that M. pyrifera may benefit physiologically from a warmer, more acidic (i.e. higher pCO₂) ocean while S. purpuratus will likely be impacted negatively. Given that S. purpuratus can exert a strong deterministic influence on M. pyrifera distribution and abundance, changes to either of their populations that might arise from climate change can alter how they interact and thus have serious consequences for many coastal environments.},

abstract = {Temporal variability of upwelling activity and primary production is examined for a southeastern Australian upwelling system off the Bonney Coast (36.5 degrees S-38.5 degrees S, 138 degrees E-142 degrees E). Three indices of upwelling activity and primary production are developed based on alongshore wind stress, upwelling plume area (anomalous sea surface temperature), and primary productivity of the upwelling plume (approximated using anomalous chlorophyll a concentration). The majority of the upwelling activity occurs during the austral summer upwelling season from November to March. Interannual variability in the wind forcing for this region shows marginal correspondence to El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability. Intraseasonal variability followed four distinct phases within the upwelling season of "onset," "sustained," "quiescent," and "downwelling" periods. The Bonney Upwelling is a predictable regional system with temporal variability of its physical forcing that is similar to larger, more intensely studied coastal wind-driven upwelling systems. However, we find that the Bonney Coast is a low wind-forced upwelling region compared to other upwelling systems. Simple linear quantitative models developed between upwelling activity predictors (wind and upwelling plume area) and the biological response (chlorophyll a) explain 40-50{\%} of the seasonal variability of approximated phytoplankton productivity along the Bonney Coast. As primary productivity in a low-wind system is not affected by the deleterious effects of turbulence and advection, these simple models are able to predict chlorophyll variability in the Bonney region. Models developed in this study provide a method of assessing the effect of decadal or longer variability of chlorophyll concentration in low wind-forcing upwelling systems at regional and global scales.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

To identify worldwide prospective distributional shifts of major biogeographical regions under a global change scenario, we applied a macroecological modeling approach. We compared the borders of biogeographical regions between present and end of the century sea surface temperatures (SST) taken from global climate model simulations and drew conclusions for distributional changes. All regions will extend towards the poles. As a consequence, the tropical region will widen considerably. However, there will be almost no change in the northern extent of the Antarctic region. According to the model data, the annual SST gradient will change along extensive coastlines creating broad transitional regions, some of which contain high seaweed genus diversity. As a consequence, the structure of the seaweed assemblages in these biogeographical regions will probably be reorganized.},

abstract = {Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were used to assess the relevance of 4 primary carbon sources (the macroalga Cystoseira balearica, decaying blades of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, seagrass epiphytes and pelagic particulate organic matter [POM]) for consumers inhabiting 3 adjoining subtidal habitats in the Western Mediterranean: seagrass meadows, unvegetated sandy patches and the overlying pelagic ecosystem. MANOVA and ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between the $\delta$ 13C signal of decaying blades of P. oceanica (–13.0 ± 0.6‰), epiphytes (–19.7 ± 0.4‰) and a third group including POM (–23.1 ± 0.3‰) and C. balearica (–22.7 ± 0.8‰). However, these primary sources did not differ in their $\delta$ 15N signals (average: 1.0‰; range: 0.8 to 1.2‰). IsoSource mixing model software was used to calculate the contribution of each primary source to the carbon assimilated by each animal species. Nested ANOVA showed that the 3 trophic webs differed in the average contribution of the decaying blades of P. oceanica to the carbon assimilated by animals. The average contribution was 46.0 ± 14.0{\%} for meadow-dwelling species, 18.3 ± 6.0{\%} for sand-dwelling species and 12.8 ± 3.0{\%} for pelagic species, once zooxanthellae-bearing jellyfish were removed from the analysis. However, IsoSource provided solutions for all the pelagic species and for half the sand-dwelling species that do not use decaying blades of P. oceanica as a carbon source. Conversely, IsoSource identified the decaying blades of P. oceanica as a relevant carbon source in all the solutions calculated for 3 different sand-dwelling species and in all of the meadowdwelling species. Thus, we conclude that organic detritus from P. oceanica is a relevant carbon source for species inhabiting seagrass meadows and for those sand-dwelling species living close to the meadows, but not for species exploiting deeper and more distant unvegetated patches.},

abstract = {Detailed observations of the variability in space and time of motions that dominate redistribution of material and heat are rare. However, these motions are vital for life in seas and ocean. Modern electronics have allowed the manufacturing of 1-Hz high-sampling rate, <1-mK precision, 6000-m depth-rated temperature sensors with the potential of 1-year uninterrupted stand-alone operation. These sensors have been specifically developed for use in a vertical array of many O(100), to study dynamic processes like fronts and internal waves in shallow seas and deep ocean. Under conditions of sufficient spatial vertical resolution, O(0.1-1. m), and temperature acting as a proper tracer for density variations, the sensors are excellent in estimating turbulence parameters generated by such processes. In the ocean interior, they reveal continuous internal wave variability and step-like vertical layering in temperature, but very little turbulence. Above sloping topography, small- and large-scale overturnings yield turbulence parameter values which vary by up to four orders of magnitude as a function of time. Largest values are observed in bursts lasting typically 500-1000. s and associated with nonlinear internal wave passages. These bursts occur irregularly in a tidal phase. When extrapolated to the ocean at large, sufficient mixing is observed above sloping boundaries to maintain the overall vertical density stratification. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Determining relationships between the ranges of introduced species and geographical and environmental factors is an important step in understanding the mechanisms and processes of the spread of introduced species. In this study, I examined the beta diversity and latitude relationship for all naturalized exotic species of vascular plants in North America at a continental scale. Beta diversity was calculated as the absolute value of the slope of the relationship between the natural logarithm of the Simpson index of similarity (lnS) and spatial distance between pairs of state-level exotic floras within four latitudinal zones examined. Relative contributions of spatial distance and environmental difference to species turnover between exotic floras were examined. I found that beta diversity decreased monotonically from low to high latitudes: beta diversity for the southernmost zone was shallower than that for the northernmost zone by a factor of 2.6. Regression models of lnS in relation to spatial distance and environmental (climatic and topographical) difference for each latitudinal zone demonstrated that the explanatory power of these variables diminishes monotonically with latitude: the explained variance in lnS is 70.4{\%}, 62.1{\%}, 53.9{\%}, and 33.9{\%}, respectively, for the four latitudinal zones from south to north. For the southernmost zone, 58.3{\%} of the variance in lnS is explained by climate variables and topography, and spatial distance explains only 2.3{\%} of the variance. In contrast, for the northernmost zone, more than half the amount (22.5{\%}) of the explained variance in lnS is attributable to spatial distance, and the remaining (18.9{\%}) of the explained variance is attributable to climate variables and topography.},

abstract = {The Succulent Karoo biome is home to the world's richest succulent flora. It has approximately 1954 endemic plant species, and is the only semi-arid region to qualify as a hotspot of global significance. Despite its importance, only 2{\%} of the biome is currently protected. Based on its flora, the biome can be divided into 12 bioregions, reflecting its high compositional turnover in relation to environmental and geographical gradients. Only three of these bioregions (the Gariep Centre, the Namaqualand Rocky Hills and the Tanqua Karoo) contain National Parks, and three contain large (over 10 000 ha) provincial reserves (the Gariep Centre, the Namaqualand Rocky Hills and the Little Karoo). The current reserve system does little to conserve biodiversity, with only one reserve significantly conserving Red Data Book (RDB) plant diversity. Using a RDB plant species database of 3874 records at a quarter degree scale (QDS = 15′ × 15′), we used hotspot analyses and iterative reserve selection algorithms to identify possible locations for future reserves. The hotspot analysis and iterative analyses yielded similar results for the top 11 QDS, mainly due to very high local endemism. Also because of the local endemism and the high species turnover within the biome, the real-world iterative algorithm (starting with the seven already reserved QDS) selected a very large total number of QDS (59{\%} of the total in the biome) to conserve all RDB species. As a possible alternative to conservation planning based on QDS, we also assessed priorities at the scale of bioregions, but showed that representation at this geographic level misses important areas defined at a finer scale. We suggest that if the objective is to maximise the retention of RDB species in the landscape (to pre-empt extinction by scheduling the allocation of limited conservation resources), at least the top 5{\%} of QDS (n = 11) selected by the iterative procedure, and identified as the core conservation sequence by analysis of endemicity and threat, should be given priority for reservation. Less extensive and, in some cases, less formal conservation action can be applied to QDS later in the sequence, based on species-specific monitoring and action plans. Of the 11 core areas, four fall in a node centred on the Vanrhynsdorp Centre, two fall in a node centred on the Kamiesberg, and the remaining five are isolated. With existing reserves, the core areas capture 50{\%} of the RDB flora in 8{\%} of the biome., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

@article{Hutchings2009,
abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19-34°S), which itself is subdivided at 26°S by the powerful Luderitz upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history cycle. While the "Bakun triad" of factors responsible for the development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment, concentration and retention) provide an important unifying principle for understanding the compromise implicit in adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the 1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during the period 1970-1990, while hake have never fully recovered from intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz-Orange River Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone. A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990 and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front. Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5 years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history patterns of these two species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These species have different temperature ranges for growth that reflect seasonal temperature extremes in their natural distributions. L. baileyana is a temperate-subtropical species which grows between 15 and 33°C, whereas L. orcadensis is a boreal-temperate species which grows between 10 and 20°C. Interspecific differences in the photosynthetic responses to temperature were similar to those for growth, suggesting that photosynthesis may determine the temperature range over which Lomentaria tetrasporophytes can grow. Light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were higher in L. orcadensis below 15°C, whereas L. baileyana could photosynthesize at temperatures above 30°C, which inhibited photosynthesis in L. orcadensis.

abstract = {Namaqualand is a winter-rainfall desert of some 50 000 km⁲, located in north-western South Africa. For a desert ecosystem, the region is characterized by a unique selective regime, namely highly predictable annual rainfall and a moderate temperature regime throughout the year. This selective regime is responsible for the unique plant ecological features of Namaqualand. These include: the dominance of communities by dwarf to low, shallow-rooted, short-lived and drought-sensitive leaf succulent shrubs; high abundance and diversity of geophytes; winter growth phenology; regular and spectacular spring flowering displays; rapid population turnover of perennials; weak competitive interactions; and high local and regional plant diversity. This paper provides a physiographical, biogeographical and ecological overview as background to this special issue. First, we outline the physiography and climate of Namaqualand, emphasizing unique components of its selective regime. Next we discuss the region's phytogeographical and floristic characteristics. Then we summarize what is known about plant form and function, focusing on growth form mix, phenology, carbon gain, water relations, and reproduction in vegetation dominated by leaf-succulent shrubs. Finally, we interpret Namaqualand's uniquely rich and dynamic plant communities in terms of plant functional processes. These plant ecological patterns and processes are discussed in terms of the predictions of a simple conceptual model for succulent-rich communities., The Plant Ecology of Namaqualand, South Africa},

abstract = {Ecologists have long struggled to explain variation in food-chain length among natural ecosystems. Food-chain length is predicted to be shorter in ecosystems subjected to greater disturbance because longer chains are theoretically less resilient to perturbation. Moreover, food-chain length is expected to be longer in larger ecosystems because increasing ecosystem size increases species richness and stabilizes predator—prey interactions, or increases total resource availability. Here we test the roles of disturbance and ecosystem size in determining the food-chain length of terrestrial food webs on Bahamian islands. We found that disturbance affected the identity of top predators, but did not change food-chain length because alternative top predators occupied similar trophic positions. On the other hand, a 10⁶-fold increase in ecosystem size elevated food-chain length by one trophic level. We suggest that the effect of disturbance on food-chain length is weak when alternate top predators are trophic omnivores and have similar trophic positions. This and previous work in lakes suggest that ecosystem size may be a strong determinant of food-chain length in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {Both Carpobrotus edulis and Senecio?mandraliscae possess leaves with a peripheral chlorenchyma and colourless internal water-storage tissue. Water stress in C. edulis growing under semi-natural conditions resulted in the induction of weak Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) whereas well-watered plants of S.?mandraliscae exhibited a similar degree of CAM. Titratable acidity in the separated water-storage tissue was substantially lower than in the chlorenchyma in both species but, nevertheless, increased during the night and decreased during the day either when sampled from the intact plant or from incubated tissue slices. Indeed, the increase in nocturnal titratable acidity produced by the water-storage tissue in situ accounted for approx. 30{\%} of total acidification on a per-leaf basis. It appears that during the night the water-storage tissue in these species is able to fix CO2 which is subsequently released during the day to enter the photosynthetic carbon-reduction cycle of the chlorenchyma. Diurnal rhythms of water potential ($\Psi$) and osmotic potential ($\Psi$s) were measured in separated chlorenchyma and water-storage tissue by thermocouple psychrometry. Both parameters increased during the latter part of the daytime and initial nocturnal period and decreased during the rest of the night and into the post-dawn period. The chlorenchyma of water-stressed plants of C. edulis appeared to possess a marked negative turgor pressure (as determined from $\Psi$—$\Psi$s) but this was caused by a severe underestimation in the measurement of the chlorenchyma $\Psi$. It is suggested that this artefact arose from release of colloidal polysaccharide mucilage, or possibly tannins, from broken tannin cells producing a lowering of water activity when measured using thermocouple psychrometry.},

abstract = {Regional sea surface temperature (SST) gradients were examined for a 6-year (2003–2008) period using data from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on two NOAA satellite platforms. Two regions, one in the California Current System and the other in the Gulf Stream, representing an eastern boundary upwelling region and strong western boundary current, respectively, were chosen to investigate the seasonal variability, statistical differences and similarities, and correlations with respect to the two sets of SST gradients. Results indicated higher gradient magnitudes using MODIS SST in relative comparison to those derived from AVHRR that are attributed to instrument and algorithm differences. These observed differences are important for any studies that employ SST gradients, such as fisheries investigations that have traditionally relied on AVHRR SST gradients only.},

abstract = {We examine the scaling law B is proportional to M(alpha)which connects organismal resting metabolic rate B with organismal mass M, where alpha is commonly held to be 3/4. Since simple dimensional analysis suggests alpha = 2/3, we consider this to be a null hypothesis testable by empirical studies. We re-analyse data sets for mammals and birds compiled by Heusner, Bennett and Harvey, Bartels, Hemmingsen, Brody, and Kleiber, and find little evidence for rejecting alpha = 2/3 in favor of alpha = 3/4. For mammals, we find a possible breakdown in scaling for larger masses reflected in a systematic increase in alpha. We also review theoretical justifications of alpha = 3/4 based on dimensional analysis, nutrient-supply networks, and four-dimensional biology. We find that present theories for alpha = 3/4 require assumptions that render them unconvincing for rejecting the null hypothesis that alpha = 2/3.},

@article{Cowling1998,
abstract = {The Karoo-Namib Region, comprising the arid lands of southern Africa, supports an extraordinarily rich and compositionally unusual flora. This region includes the winter-rainfall Succulent Karoo (part of the Greater Cape Flora), the summer-rainfall Nama Karoo, and incorporates the Namib Desert. The Succulent Karoo is home to the world's largest succulent flora and is very rich in geophytes. Species-area patterns at the regional scale (10{\&}lt;sup{\&}gt;1{\&}lt;/sup{\&}gt;-10{\&}lt;sup{\&}gt;6{\&}lt;/sup{\&}gt; km{\&}lt;sup{\&}gt;2{\&}lt;/sup{\&}gt;) show that the Succulent Karoo had 2.6 times as many species per unit area than the Nama Karoo. The Succulent Karoo was also richer than other winter-rainfall, semi-arid (100-400 mmyr{\&}lt;sup{\&}gt;-1{\&}lt;/sup{\&}gt;) regions of the world, having, for example, nearly four times as many species than equivalent-sized North American regions. Similarly, southern African winter-rainfall desert ({\&}lt;100 mmyr{\&}lt;sup{\&}gt;-1{\&}lt;/sup{\&}gt;) regions were exceptionally species-rich: here 331 species have been recorded in an area of 1 3 km{\&}lt;sup{\&}gt;2{\&}lt;/sup{\&}gt;. The Namib Desert, which spans the Succulent and Nama Karoo regions, has up to 200 times the number of species that similar-sized areas of the Saharan Desert. On the other hand, the Nama Karoo does not appear to be unusually rich at the regional scale. The Succulent Karoo represents a major extratropical centre of plant biodiversity. Reasons for its high diversity include unusually predictable seasonal rainfall and relatively mild summers. The climatic regime has selected for short-lived and drought-sensitive shrub lifestyles, largely associated with dwarf to low leaf succulents. A combination of short generation times and limited gene flow has resulted in massive diversification within certain lineages (especially the Mesembryanthema), leading to the fine-scale discrimination of habitat and geographic space. Plant-pollinator coevolution appears to have played some role in the diversification of the region's large geophyte flora.},

abstract = {Current macroecological research places great emphasis on patterns of species richness (alpha diversity) and the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes involved in their origin and maintenance. However, few studies dealing with continental scales have addressed dissimilarities in species composition among areas (beta diversity). Using data for the occurrence of 3836 bird and 1641 mammal species in 4220 cells covering the New World, we assessed whether broad-scale macroecological patterns in beta diversity are related to dissimilarities in environmental variables and biotic units. We employed spatial regression and tree regression to model beta diversity. Difference in altitude was the best predictor of beta diversity. Accordingly, the highest beta diversity values were found in mountainous areas, particularly in the Andes, Central America and western North America. Explanatory variables related to transitions between biotic units (biome, ecoregion) were relatively unimportant. Areas that differ in altitude from their surroundings harbor different sets of species, and this may reflect either species adaptation to particular environmental conditions by range shifts, or species divergence by vicariance, or both.},

abstract = {We analyze the role of urban green areas managed by local user groups in their potential for supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services in growing city-regions, with focus on allotment areas, domestic gardens, and golf courses. Using Stockholm, Sweden, as an example cityregion, we compile GIS data of its spatial characteristics and relate these data to GIS data for protected areas and "green wedges" prioritized in biodiversity conservation. Results reveal that the three land uses cover 18{\%} of the studied land area of metropolitan Stockholm, which corresponds to more than twice the land set aside as protected areas. We review the literature to identify ecosystem functions and services provided by the three green areas and discuss their potential in urban ecosystem management. We conclude that the incorporation of locally managed lands, and their stewards and institutions, into comanagement designs holds potential for improving conditions for urban biodiversity, reducing transaction costs in ecosystem management, and realizing local Agenda 21.},

abstract = {The influence of temperature and light on growth and photosynthetic physiology were investigated in embryos of Fucus evanescens grown at 5 or 20 °C under irradiances of 15 or 150 $\mu$mol photons m−2 s−1 for 7–10 days. Growth was light-independent, but high-temperature embryos were always significantly larger than those grown at low temperature. Photosynthesis-irradiance responses were measured at growth temperature and a standard temperature (20 °C) to isolate instantaneous effects of temperature from acclimation responses. Our data indicate that growth and photosynthesis are uncoupled during the early development of Fucus, and that acclimation of the photosynthetic light-harvesting apparatus occurred. Light-limited net photosynthesis (P sub-sat) responded similarly to high temperature and low light. Rates of P sub-sat were similar in embryos grown at 20 °C (regardless of light) and at 5 °C in low (c. 1.2 nmol O2 mm−3 min−1), whereas those of 5 °C high-light embryos were lower (c. −0.04 nmol O2mm−3 min−1).

@article{Anderson2009a,
abstract = {Aim To study the siting of marine protected areas (MPAs) with respect to the biogeographical distribution of seaweeds within the Agulhas Marine Province and to assess the effectiveness of current MPAs in including (conserving) seaweeds of the South African south coast. Location South Africa – the south coast between Cape Agulhas and the Eastern Cape/Kwazulu-Natal border, and eight MPAs within that area. Methods We used interpolated seaweed distribution records from all available sources, in 50-km coastal sections. Cluster analysis (Jaccard Average Linkage) of species presence/absence data provided measures of similarity between coastal sections and between MPAs. Complementarity analyses identified the sequence of ‘importance’ of sections/MPAs for conserving seaweed species. Results Species presence/absence data indicated two main groups, representing western (cooler water) and eastern (warmer water) biogeographical divisions, as well as several biogeographical subdivisions within each of these groups. Complementarity analysis yielded a sequence of ‘importance’ of coastal sections (in terms of the highest number of species included) that began with a section just east of central in the Agulhas Marine Province, around Port Alfred, where there is no MPA. This was followed by the easternmost section (warmest water), which contains the Pondoland MPA, and then by the westernmost (coolest water) section, containing the De Hoop MPA. Similar analysis of the actual species collected in MPAs showed a generally similar pattern. Main conclusions Seven current MPAs and one proposed coastal MPA in the Agulhas Marine Province appear to be well distributed and well sited to include (conserve) the full biogeographical range of seaweeds. However, if further MPAs are to be considered, the Port Alfred area is recommended for improved conservation. This study did not examine estuaries, which may require improved conservation efforts. Seaweed distribution data, which are often relatively complete, offer a good tool for planning the siting of coastal MPAs.},
